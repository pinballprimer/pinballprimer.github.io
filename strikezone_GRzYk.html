<h1>Strike Zone (Williams, 1970)</h1>

<p>Despite "strike zone" being a commonly used baseball term, this is a bowling-themed game, and it is not to be confused with Strike (Zaccaria, 1978), Striker (Gottlieb, 1982), or Strikes and Spares (Bally, 1978).</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>If the second top lane from left is lit, plunge it for 300 points and a Strike. If it's not lit, plunge the 3rd lane from right to raise the center post. Standup targets in the top corners of the playfield collect A-B-C-D, which lights the bumpers and lanes around the playfield for additional value. Make strikes by pressing all of the center rollover buttons; each strike scores 300, three strikes scores extra ball, and strikes after the third each score a Special.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>There are 4 top lanes, which score 100 points. If you have no Strikes, the second lane from left is lit for Strike, meaning that lane scores 300 points instead of 100 and spots one whole Strike. The third top lane from left always raises the center post between the flippers. The leftmost and rightmost top lanes do nothing besides score the 100 points.</p>

<h3>A-B-C-D letters</h3>

<p>The A and B targets are in the upper left, and the C and D targets are in the upper right. The C and D targets can just barely be shot directly from a strong flipper, but the A and B targets are obscured by pop bumpers. All of these standup targets score 10 points and award the indicated letter. Earning a letter lights the corresponding pop bumper for 10 points instead of 1. Collecting A or D lights the left or right out lane respectively for 300 points instead of 100. Collecting B or C lights the left or right upper side lane for 100 points instead of 10 respectively. Lighting all four of A-B-C-D opens a gate in the right out lane which redirects the ball back to the shooter lane for a replunge. Using the gate resets the A-B-C-D sequence.</p>

<p>Collected A-B-C-D letters and the features they lit are preserved from ball to ball. This means they are also preserved from player to player in a 2-player game. In theory, this gives a slight advantage to player 2 early in a game, as player 1 always starts the game with no letters collected, but they may light letters for player 2 to use at the start of their first ball. Completing A-B-C-D then using the right out lane gate removes the letters for everybody.</p>

<h3>Strikes</h3>

<p>The "pin" rollover buttons in the center of the table score 1 point. Press a lit button to unlight it. Unlight all 10 buttons to score a Strike, which awards 300 points. If you make 3 Strikes in a single ball, you are awarded an extra ball, and any further Strikes on the same ball each score a Special (which as far as I know can only be worth a free game). To the left and right of the buttons, the walls that mark off the upper side lanes actually have slingshots on the sides the face the center of the playfield, encouraging more side-to-side ball movement and making it a little easier to collect pins.<br>If you have not yet collected your first Strike, the second top lane from left spots the first Strike for you. All earned Strikes and collected pins are reset from player to player and ball to ball.</p>

<p>In a 5-ball game, you must always press all 10 rollover buttons to record a Strike. In a 3-ball game, this is made slightly easier; for the first Strike, the 1-2 and 4-5 pins are tied together, and for the second Strike, the 8-9 pins are tied together. Collecting either pin in a "tied together" pair as described gives credit for both pins.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table and center post</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes. Flippers back up directly to the slingshots. Full size 3 inch flippers are used. Slingshots score 1 points. Out lanes score 100 points, or 300 when lit; to light the out lanes, collect the A (left) and D (right).</p>

<p>There is a center post between the flippers that temporarily completely blocks off the center drain. The center post is raised by making the third top lane from left, or by pressing the Up Post buttons near the upper left and right side lanes. The center post is lowered when the game is tilted, when the ball drains, or when the Down Post button just above the post is pressed.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus. Tilt ends the ball in play only. Maximum 1 extra ball per ball in play. As far as I am aware, extra balls and Specials cannot be set to award a point value in competition/novelty play.</p>
