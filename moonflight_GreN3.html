<h1>Moon Flight (Zaccaria, 1976)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Shoot orbits all day.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Top lanes score 50,000 points and a bonus advance. Making a lit top lane unlights it. Unlighting all 4 lanes will relight exactly one lane; this lit lane will move each time a 1,000-point switch is hit. Making the lane corresponding to this moving light scores an extra ball. All top lane progress is reset every ball.</p>

<h3>50,000 points and a bonus advance</h3>

<p>The in lanes, lower left standup targets, upper left and right standup targets, and right orbit can all be lit for 50,000 points and a bonus advance. If they are not lit, they score 1,000 points only. 1,000 point switches anywhere in the game alternate whether these features are lit or not.</p>

<h3>Left orbit</h3>

<p>Always scores 50,000 points and a bonus advance. If the bonus has been advanced to the maximum, this orbit is lit for an extra ball. I have seen this shot score 300,000 points when lit instead of an extra ball as well; I am unsure if this is a game setting or an operator's modification.</p>

<h3>Advance Module</h3>

<p>The four standup targets on the right are labelled 2, 5, 3, and 1 from top to bottom. Hitting a target in this bank scores 1,000 points times the number on the target's label, and also advances the white light in the spiral by the number of positions equal to the target's label. Every 10 white light advances over the course of the game adds one letter in the word Orbit. Lighting the T in Orbit (or an earlier letter, based on operator settings) will light the center standup target and one of the two out lanes for Special. This Special awards a free game; I am not sure if it can be set to an extra ball or points. The center standup target scores 50,000 points and a bonus advance when it is not lit for Special.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Moon Flight has a conventional in/out lane setup. Slingshots score 100 points. In lanes score 1,000 points, or 50,000 and a bonus advance when lit; in lanes are lit alternately based on 1,000-point switch hits. Out lanes score 50,000 points and a bonus advance when not lit, or a Special when lit; out lanes are lit alternately based on 1,000 point switch hits only after an operator-determined letter in Orbit is lit.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>The left orbit, any top lane, and center standup target always award one bonus advance. The right orbit, in lanes, and all other yellow standup targets award one bonus advance when lit. Each bonus advance is worth 10,000 points in end of ball bonus. Advancing the base bonus to its maximum value of 100,000 automatically lights double bonus as well, effectively making the last bonus advance worth 110,000 points. Max bonus is 2x 100,000 = 200,000 points. Bonus cannot be collected mid-ball or held from ball to ball.</p>

<p>Tilt ends game.</p>
