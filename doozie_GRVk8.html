<h1>Doozie / Daffie / Freak Out (Williams, 1968)</h1>

<p>Doozie is the original replay version.<br>Daffie is the add-a-ball version.<br>Freak Out is a one-of-a-kind artwork modification of Doozie, listed here because it traditionally appears in the Pinburgh major tournament each summer.<br>Differences between the replay and add-a-ball versions are discussed throughout the guide as they are relevant. Note in advance that all scoring on Daffie is multiplied by 10 compared to scoring on Doozie/Freak Out due to the introduction of a dummy reel used to inflate scores.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p><i>Doozie/Freak Out:</i> complete the 1-2-3-4-5 sequence of rollover lanes and buttons exactly 1 or 4 times so that the center pop bumper is lit for 100 points, then milk that bumper for all it's worth. If you accidentally complete too many sequences, abandon the bumper strategy and just try to complete further 1-2-3-4-5 sequences, which score 300 points each.<br><i>Daffie:</i> since Daffie has no center pop bumper, complete as many 1-2-3-4-5 sequences as you can, but make sure you hit the 5,000 point drop target whenever it's available; it only re-raises itself when a 1-2-3-4-5 is completed.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>1-2-3-4-5 sequences and "Xs"</h3>

<p>The numbers 1-2-3-4-5 can each be collected in two places. The 1-2-3-4 top lanes and the 5 rollover button above them are one location; there are also rollover buttons labelled 1-2-3-4-5 in the center of the playfield in an X shape. Make a lit button or lane to unlight it, collecting the corresponding number. Top lanes always score 100 points, and rollover buttons always score 1 point. Collecting all of the 1-2-3-4-5 numbers scores 300 points, lights one X in the row of lights near the flippers, and resets the sequence.</p>

<p>The number of completed Xs governs which pop bumper(s) are lit.</p>
<ul>
	<li>0X: top left, top right, bottom left, and bottom right bumpers are lit</li>
	<li>1X: center bumper is lit only</li>
	<li>2X: top right and bottom left bumpers are lit</li>
	<li>3X: top left and bottom right bumpers are lit</li>
	<li>4X: center bumper is lit, on easy settings; otherwise, no bumpers are lit</li>
	<li>5X and onward: no bumpers are lit</li>
</ul>
<p>On Doozie and Freak Out, the center bumper scores 10 points when not lit or 100 when lit, and all other bumpers score 1 point when not lit or 10 when lit. Getting the ball stuck in the pop bumper nest when the 100-point bumper is lit is the fastest and most efficient way to increase your score by a significant margin.<br>On Daffie, there is no center bumper. The above list still governs when the other 4 pop bumpers are lit. In place of the center pop bumper is a triangular wall structure with a single drop target facing the flippers. This drop target scores 5,000 points when knocked down; the only way to re-raise it is by completing the 1-2-3-4-5 sequence and earning another X. Be sure to hit this target whenever it's available, even avoiding completing 1-2-3-4-5 to do so, lest you leave 5,000 points behind by completing the sequence when the drop target was already raised.</p>

<p>Three flavors of Special are lit based on the number of Xs that have been completed. Specials always score a free game on Doozie/Freak Out; specials score 1 extra ball or 10,000 points on Daffie. Specials do not unlight when collected; the only way to unlight a Special is to advance the number of completed Xs past the point where the Special is qualified.</p>
<ul>
	<li>A Special is scored by using the upper right gate when it is lit red. To use the gate, it must be opened by hitting the upper left standup target. The gate is always lit at exactly 2 adjacent X values: this can be 2X and 3X on easy settings, 3X and 4X on medium settings, or 4X and 5X on hard settings.</li>
	<li>The left and right out lanes are lit alternately for a Special at certain X values. The Special alternates between the two out lanes and time a 1-point switch is scored. The out lane Special is always available at 2 different X values: 4X and 6X on easy settings, 5X and 7X on medium, or 6X and 8X on hard. Since the X counter maxes at 8, on hard settings, making it to 8X will light the out lane Special for the rest of the game.</li>
	<li>At certain X values, simply completing another 1-2-3-4-5 sequence earns an instant Special. Like the out lane Special, this opportunity is always available at exactly 2 spaced-apart values: 3X and 5X on easy settings, 4X and 6X on medium settings, 5X and 7X on semi-medium settings, or 6X and 8X on hard settings. If this is set to Hard, every 1-2-3-4-5 completion scores a Special after 8X has been reached.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Upper right gate</h3>

<p>The upper left standup target scores 100 points and opens the free ball gate in the upper right. Making the free ball gate when it is open scores 300 points and closes the gate, and also scores a Special when lit at certain X values. Draining the ball instantly closes the gate. A right flipper backhand shot when the zipper flippers are closed may be able to shoot the gate directly, but realistically the gate needs to be accessed from the pop bumper area.</p>

<h3>Middle playfield standup targets</h3>

<p>The middle-left and middle-right of the playfield each have a pair of standup targets. These targets always score 10 points (100 on Daffie). The target further from the flippers in each pair zips the flippers together, temporarily completely blocking off the center drain as a reward. The near target in each pair reopens the flippers. Using the upper right gate also reopens the flippers if they are closed.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes. Slingshots score 1 point. Two inch mini-flippers are used, which can be zipped together as described above. Out lanes score 100 points and are lit alternately for Special at two different operator-adjustable X values.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus. Collected Xs do not serve as a multiplier for any scoring, they only refer to the number of 1-2-3-4-5 completions made and are so named because of the shape the 1-2-3-4-5 rollover buttons make in the center of the playfield. On Doozie and Freak Out, tilt ends game. On Daffie, tilt ends the ball in play only.</p>
