<h1>Fore (Bally, 1973)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Keep the center post raised whenever possible by using the Up Post buttons above the slingshots and avoiding the Down Post button near the center standup target. Collect 4 Holes in the lower half of the playfield by hitting lit rollover buttons in order, then hit the side standup targets for 5,000 points each. Completing the 1-9 sequence or unlighting all 10 of the upper standup targets awards a Special, which can score a free game, an extra ball, or 5,000 points.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes and Yards upper standup targets</h3>

<p>The 10 standup targets at the top corners of the table start lit, and are labelled with various numbers of Yards between 25 and 100. Despite the listed Yard value, these targets always score 100 points. The left top lane spots the 25 Yards target on the left, and the right top lane spots the 45 Yards target on the right; both of these top lanes give 100 points as well. Hit a Yards target to unlight it. Unlighting all 10 targets will reset them and award a Special, which can be worth a free game, an extra ball, 5,000 points, or nothing.</p>

<p>The center top lane always scores 1,000 points. It is lit alternately based on 10-point switch hits. Making the center top lane when lit advances one Hole at the bottom of the playfield.</p>

<h3>Holes and lower standup targets</h3>

<p>The lower half of the playfield features 9 mini rollover buttons. These buttons are lit one at a time in order. Unlight buttons score 0 points. Lit buttons score 500 points, and move the light to the next numbered button, which counts as completing that "hole". Completing 1, 2, or 3 holes (adjustable) lights the center standup target for 5,000 points, and lights the lower left and right targets alternately for 5,000 as well. Completing 4 holes lights all three 5,000-point targets solidly. When not lit, the center standup target scores 1,000 and the lower side standup targets score 100. In a 3-ball game only, completing hole 9 awards a Special (worth a free game, extra ball, 5,000 points, or nothing); earning this Special causes both the Hole sequence and the Yards target sequence to be reset.</p>

<h3>Pop bumpers</h3>

<p>Score 10 points or 100 when lit. One colour is lit at a time (either red in the upper right and lower left, or blue in the upper left and lower right); which colour is lit switches at the start of each ball or any time a 500-point target is scored (lit Hole rollover button or out lane). </p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Slingshots score 10 points. Out lanes score 500 points. There are no in lanes; the full size three inch flippers back up directly to the slingshots. A center post that completely blocks the center drain is raised via the larger rollover buttons directly above the slingshots, and is lowered by the larger rollover button directly in front of the center standup target.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus. Tilt ends game. Fore supports add-a-ball play, so it is possible to earn more than one extra ball during a single ball-in-play.</p>
