<h1>Popeye Saves the Earth (Bally Williams, 1994)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Popeye has a lot of deep and unique playfield features, but for scoring, nothing matches the vaue of Bluto Multiball. Light locks via the timing-based skill shot or hitting the two Jab targets at Bluto's cheeks; lock balls in Bluto's mouth. In multiball, shoot the left ramp to score a jackpot and Bluto to relight it. Completing the POP targets on the left or EYE on the right gives an increasing award of up to 20,000,000 points and lights a Spinach Can, a one-time 2x shot multiplier, on a random shot. Beware the shorter-than-normal lightning flippers and the inability to use a post transfer.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>Popeye's skill shot is a timing-based skill shot. The launch button on the front of the cabinet fires the ball into a spinning wheel with 8 awards; whichever hole you land in is what you receive.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Spot Item: gives one of the four Items needed for Item Multiball</li>
	<li>100,000 points</li>
	<li>10,000,000 points</li>
	<li>Lite Lock: at Bluto's mouth for Bluto Multiball</li>
	<li>Spinach Can: light one random Spinach Can</li>
	<li>Oyl: spots one letter in Oyl, which is otherwise earned at the top lanes</li>
	<li>Spot Animal: gives one of the five Animals needed to start Stampede</li>
	<li>2,000,000 points</li>
</ul>
<p>The kickout from the skill shot can sometimes feed the right flipper rather quickly, so be alert. Skill shots are available at the start of any ball and after locks are made toward Bluto Multiball.</p>

<h3>Spinach Cans</h3>

<p>5 shots in the game have a Spinach Can insert in front of them: both orbits, both upper saucers, and the left ramp. Completing the POP standup targets on the left or the EYE standup targets on the right lights one Spinach Can and awards points: 2,000,000 for the first completion of either bank, increasing by 1,000,000 each time up to a maximum of 20,000,000. Spinach Cans can also be lit from the skill shot or escalator awards. When a Spinach Can is lit, the next shot made where the Spinach Can is lit scores 2x value and unlights that Spinach Can. This is less useful than you might expect, but can be helpful in multiball, as a left ramp Spinach Can does apply to the jackpot.</p>

<h3>Bluto Multiball</h3>

<p>There are three ways to light a lock for Bluto Multiball: a skill shot award, an escalator award, or by hitting the two Jab targets located on either side of Bluto's mouth. To lock a ball, shoot into Bluto's mouth. Locking 3 balls starts the 3-ball Bluto Multiball. In multiball, the left ramp scores a jackpot. After collecting a jackpot, shoot Bluto's mouth to relight the jackpot. Jackpots start at 30,000,000 points and increase by 30,000,000 each time, up to a maximum of 180,000,000 points. If a Spinach Can is lit at the left ramp, the jackpot value will be doubled, but this is still subject to the 180,000,000 point limit. Bluto Multiball can effectively be played with a single flipper, since both the left ramp and Bluto's mouth feed the right flipper, so trap one or more balls on the left flipper and use the right flipper to pick off multiball awards for as long as possible.</p>

<p>If multiball ends before any jackpots are scored, you can shoot Bluto's mouth within 15 seconds to restart multiball. A restarted multiball will only have 2 balls. Playing Bluto Multiball is one of the four requirements for Olive Multiball wizard mode.</p>

<h3>Fight Bluto Cartel: main modes</h3>

<p>To fight Bluto in a main mode, you must shoot the upper right saucer (on the main playfield, just past the right side of Bluto) when lit. If this saucer is not lit, spell Oyl at the top lanes to light it. Popeye has only 4 main modes, and all have the same rules: hit flashing shots and targets to stop Bluto. These modes do not have a conventional timer, and are played tug-of-war style: hitting flashing shots makes progress toward Popeye winning the mode, and Bluto makes progress toward winning as time passes. Modes only end when either Popeye or Bluto wins, or when the ball drains. The main difference between the modes is which shots are flashing. </p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Spill Oil Co.:</i> the orbits and the Sea Hag post targets next to the orbits are flashing. Popeye and Bluto are both trying not to drown in leaked oil. This mode can be completed in just one or two quick shots.</li>
	<li><i>Blutonium Waste:</i> the orbits, Sea Hag post targets, and Jab targets are flashing. Hit any of them to remove a barrel of toxic waste from the river. If all are removed, Popeye wins. This mode is easiest to clear quickly, as there are only 2 or 3 barrels to start; if you get to 5 or 6 barrels, it's hard enough to fight back that it's easier to lose the mode and restart.</li>
	<li><i>Never Green Logging:</i> the Jab targets on Bluto's face and the Sea Hag targets next to the orbits are flashing. Popeye tries to make trees grow while Bluto burns them down. Have 5 trees on screen at once to win.</li>
	<li><i>Earth Pavers:</i> almost everything is flashing. The display is covered by up to 15 bricks. Hitting any flashing target removes one brick; win the mode by destroying all of the bricks. Since each pop bumper hit also removes a brick, this mode can be completed quickly by shooting orbits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any shot that contributes to a mode scores minor points (about 1,000,000?). Winning any Fight mode scores 10,000,000 points. Winning all 4 Fight modes scores 25,000,000 points and is one of the four requirements for Olive Multiball wizard mode. If you fail a Fight mode, the upper right saucer is lit right away so you can immediately try again. If you win a Fight mode, the upper right saucer will stay unlit (complete the Oyl top lanes to relight it), and you will be unable to play the completed mode until after all 4 Fights are won. Shooting the lit upper right saucer starts the currently flashing mode; pop bumpers rotate which mode is flashing. Fight modes can be started during any multiball, and any multiball can be started during Fight modes.</p>

<h3>Items and Item Multiball</h3>

<p>Items can be collected in three ways: as a skill shot award, an escalator award, or by hitting both the Sea and Hag post targets near the orbits followed by the left ramp. Collecting all 4 Items is one of the four requirements for Olive Multiball wizard mode. When all four items are collected, shoot the upper left saucer on the main playfield to start Item Multiball. Item Multiball is a 4-ball multiball. The objective of Item Multiball is to shoot any POP or EYE target, any Jab target, any Swee Pea gate on the upper playfield, and the 2x Wheel shot at the top right of the upper playfield. Making all 4 of these shots over the course of multiball returns the collected items to their rightful owners, scores 50,000,000 points, and resets the multiball progression. You do not need to play Item Multiball or score the Item Jackpot to make progress toward wizard mode.</p>

<h3>Animals and Stampede Mode</h3>

<p>There are 4 ways to earn Animals, with the first two being the skill shot and the escalator award. The third (and most common) method is a little bit more of a process. First, shoot the upper left saucer to send the ball to the Animals lanes along the left side of the playfield. Second, when the ball gets close to one of the flashing animal paths, press the left flipper to pop the ball into that animal's hole. Third, shoot either orbit within 20 seconds to collect that animal. The fourth and final method is to use the escalator on the right to reach the upper playfield, then hit the two standup targets on the left, then shoot the lit Super Animal lane in the top left of the upper playfield to get a chance to kick the ball into a flashing animal. Collecting an animal scores 5,000,000 points, or 10,000,000 if done via Super Animal. Collecting all 5 animals by any means is one of the four requirements for Olive Multiball wizard mode and starts Stampede Mode, which is a hurry-up collected at the left ramp. The Stampede hurry-up starts at 40,000,000 points and counts down to 10,000,000 before timing out. You do not need to collect the hurry-up to make progress toward wizard mode.</p>

<h3>Olive Multiball wizard mode</h3>

<p>After completing the Map by winning all 4 Bluto fights, playing Bluto Multiball, collecting all 4 Items, and collecting all 5 Animals, the game will prompt you to shoot any popper to start Olive Multiball. "Any popper" includes the upper left or upper right saucers, or Bluto's mouth. Contrary to popular belief, you do not need to find Swee Pea (see next section) to be able to play Olive Multiball. Olive Multiball is a 5-ball multiball with only one goal: shoot all 5 Spinach shots, then shoot a ball into Lockjaw (Bluto's mouth). If you succeed, you score the Super Jackpot, which starts at 200,000,000 and increases by 100,000 each time a game is played. Scoring the Super Jackpot resets it to 200,000,000, then all balls are allowed to drain and single ball play resumes. If multiball ends before you collect the Super Jackpot, you must complete all 4 main objectives to restart Olive Multiball for another chance.</p>

<h3>Escalator, upper playfield, and finding Swee Pea</h3>

<p>Shooting underneath the skill shot wheel in the direction that the blue arrow is pointing puts the ball in the escalator, where it will go up to the upper playfield. If Select Award is lit, you'll get about 4 seconds before the ball pops up to choose an award on the DMD. Press the flippers to see a new award, or leave them alone if you're happy with what's shown. After 4 seconds pass, you receive the award shown. Known awards include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Points: 20, 50, 70, 100, 1,000, 1,000,000, 3,000,000, 10,000,000, probably others</li>
	<li>Extra Ball: lights an extra ball at the 2x Wheel shot in the top right of the upper playfield</li>
	<li>Light Lock (for Bluto Multiball)</li>
	<li>Spot Animal</li>
	<li>Spot Item</li>
	<li>Light Escalator (this seems redundant, I have no idea what its actual purpose is)</li>
	<li>Spinach Can</li>
	<li>Spot POP</li>
	<li>Spot EYE</li>
</ul>
<p>This list may not be exhaustive.</p>

<p>The main draw of the upper playfield is the Find Swee Pea interactive video mode. While on the upper playfield in single ball play, the game will show a map, with an X that marks Swee Pea's location. The lights in front of the three gates at the top of the upper playfield indicate whether you are able to move left, forward, or right. Shoot a lit gate to score 1,000,000 points and move in that direction. If you are able to move to where Swee Pea is, you win 30,000,000 points.</p>

<p>The ball can be shot back into the escalator. If this happens, Popeye says "goin' up" and the ball is immediately popped back to the upper playfield.</p>

<p>The top right exit to the upper playfield leads back to the Wheel, scoring a skill shot award. Hitting both of the standup targets on the left of the upper playfield lights 2x Wheel, meaning whatever Wheel award is earned will be doubled. This shot is also lit for Extra Ball if the Extra Ball escalator award is earned.</p>

<p>The top left exit to the upper playfield usually just feeds the ball to the left in lane on the main playfield. However, if the top left exit has been lit by hitting the two upper playfield standup targets, Super Animal is qualified, meaning the ball can be kicked into a flashing animal lane to score 10,000,000 points and collect that animal.</p>

<h3>Roundhouse Loop shots</h3>

<p>One in lane is lit at all times. Flipper lane change alternates which in lane is lit. Going through a lit in lane lights the opposite orbit for a Roundhouse Loop, which scores 2,000,000 points. After making a Roundhouse Loop, consecutive shots to the same orbit without missing each score 2,000,000 more than the last, up to a maximum of at least 10,000,000 points.</p>

<h3>Ramp Loop</h3>

<p>The game keeps track of the number of left ramps scored in a game. Awards are given at various thresholds. I have observed Light Extra Ball (at the left out lane) at 7/8 (adjustable) and 50; Spot Animal at 10; and Spot Spinach at 4, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 33, 38, 44, and 60.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Popeye has a conventional in/out lane setup. However, since the game is a widebody with normal sized slingshots, the flippers are far away from the slings, making post transfers or post catches impossible. In lanes are lit alternately with lane change for Lite Loop, which qualifies Roundhouse Loops at the opposite orbit shot. The left out lane is lit for extra ball after 8 or 50 left ramp shots. The right out lane can be lit for Special, but I have not seen how: I would expect this to be caused by either an escalator award or Ramp Loop award that I have never seen.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>The end of ball bonus calculation on Popeye is not very well explained. It appears to be calculated as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>100,000 points per Fight shot scored this ball, plus</li>
	<li>1,000,000 per Animal collected this ball, plus</li>
	<li>1,000,000 per Item collected this ball, plus</li>
	<li>250,000 per Roundhouse Loop made this ball, plus</li>
	<li>a flat 1,500,000 in base bonus</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a bonus multiplier that can be advanced as high as 10x by completing the Oyl top lanes, but this bonus multiplier either only applies to the 1,500,000 flat base bonus, or does not apply to anything due to a bug. Regardless, end of ball bonus is usually not worth as much on Popeye as it seems like it should be. There is no end of ball bonus collect or bonus holdover as far as I have discovered.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>The game manual indicates that in competition/novelty play, Specials score 30,000,000 points. There does not appear to be a setting that assigns a point value to extra balls.</p>

<p>The first Ramp Loop extra ball can be lit at anywhere from 4 to 15 ramps (default is 8). The second Ramp Loop extra ball can be turned on or off, but is always at 50 ramps if it is on.</p>

<p>The Stampede hurry-up starting value can be adjusted to anywhere between 20,000,000 and 60,000,000 points. The default is 40,000,000, and the ending value is always 10,000,000 points.</p>

<p>The amount of time allowed to select an escalator award can be set to anywhere from 2 to 7 seconds. Default is 4.</p>
