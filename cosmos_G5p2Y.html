<h1>Cosmos / Cosmint (Bally, 1969)</h1>

<p>Cosmos was renamed to Cosmint for distribution in Switzerland for trademark reasons. Cosmos and Cosmint have identical rules and scoring.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Priority 1 is always to hit the red mushroom bumper on the left to close the flippers if they are open- the flippers are open at the start of each ball or after hitting a yellow mushroom bumper. Blue mushroom bumpers each light one planet in front of the Blast Off hole in the top left. When the Blast Off hole is made, score 100 points for each lit rollover button that belongs to a lit planet. Qualifying and collecting Blast Off is the only worthwhile scoring. Collecting any Blast Off value between 4 and 9 times (adjustable) awards a Special, worth 0 points in competition.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes and skill shot</h3>

<p>The two outer top lanes score 10 points. The middle top lane starts each ball at a value of 100 points; hitting either of the wall switches the form a funnel toward the top lanes increases the center lane's value to 200 points for the rest of the ball. The 200 point value is achieved by having two separate buttons in the center top lane, with one of them only registering if the center top lane is lit; for this reason, it is possible to earn only 100 points for going halfway up the center top lane even after it is lit.</p>

<h3>Pop bumpers</h3>

<p>The yellow pop bumper always scores 10 points, and the green pop bumpers always score 1 point. I have seen some copies of Cosmos where the yellow bumper was in the upper right, and some where it was in the lower right. I am unsure which configuration is original or correct.</p>

<h3>Red and yellow mushroom bumpers</h3>

<p>These mushroom bumpers score 10 points. The red mushroom bumper on the left zips the flippers together, completely blocking off the center drain. Hitting either of the two yellow mushroom bumpers on the right reopens the flippers. Having the flippers closed as frequently as possible is paramount for having your ball on Cosmos last for any significant length of time.</p>

<h3>Blue mushroom bumpers, Blast Off, and Fuel Pods</h3>

<p>Hitting a blue mushroom bumper scores 10 points and lights the corresponding "planet" in front of the Blast Off saucer in the top left. The "planets" are Mars in the top left, Moon in the bottom right, and Saturn in the bottom left. Each of these three planets also has a corresponding set of 3 tiny rollover buttons across the middle of the playfield. Pressing any of these buttons scores 10 points and lights that button.<br>The Blast Off saucer is in the back left of the game, and is obscured from the player's view by plastic. Making this saucer when at least one "planet" is lit does the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>scores 100 points for each lit mini-rollover button that belongs to a lit "planet"</li>
	<li>awards one Fuel Pod</li>
	<li>unlights all lit "planets" and rollover buttons</li>
</ul>
<p>Fuel Pods are tracked by the yellow score reel next to each player's score; despite its location on the backglass, the Fuel Pod count is NOT part of your conventional pinball score. A Fuel Pod is earned every time a Blast Off is scored with at least one "planet" lit. The only purpose of the Fuel Pod count is to earn Specials, which can occur at anywhere from 4 to 9 Fuel Pods based on operator settings. To my knowledge, Special can only be worth a free game, and cannot be set to score points.</p>

<h3>Right out lane gate</h3>

<p>If at least one "planet" is lit <i>and</i> the flippers are NOT currently zipped together, pressing either of the larger rollover buttons near the slingshots will open the gate in the right out lane. The gate closes when it is used, when the ball drains, when the game is tilted, or when the flippers are zipped together. If the gate was open prior to the flippers being zipped together, the gate will be reopened when the flippers are unzipped (unless the flippers unzip due to a tilt or drained ball). The Same Player Shoots Again light on the playfield is not used for a conventional extra ball feature; it is merely to remind a player that has used the gate that their turn has not ended, even though the ball briefly ended up in an out lane.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes. The 2-inch mini flippers back up directly to the slingshots. Slingshots score 1 point and are angled quite shallow, taking a similar angle above the horizontal as a lowered, unzipped flipper. The gap between the flippers is quite wide when they are not zipped together, hence why it is so important to keep them zipped as much as possible. The right out lane is double-height, with two entry points and a small wall between them. There is only a scoring switch in the lower part. Out lanes score 50 points. The right out lane gate (which is opened and closed as described in the previous section) is positioned below the right out lane's 50-point switch.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus or extra ball feature. Lit planets, rollover buttons, and top lanes are reset after every ball. Tilt ends the ball in play only.</p>
