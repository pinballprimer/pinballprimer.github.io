<h1>Lucky Strike / Bowl a Strike (Williams, 1965)</h1>

<p>Lucky Strike is the replay version. Bowl a Strike is the add-a-ball version. Differences between the two are mentioned throughout the guide.<br>Lucky Strike is not to be confused with Lucky Strike (Gottlieb, 1975), which is the Italian add-a-ball version of El Dorado/Gold Strike.</p>

<h2>Game rules</h2>

<p>Collect Strikes by making lit top lanes, lit upper left and right standup targets, or lit side saucers. Making 10 strikes lights the out lanes alternately for a Special (Lucky Strike) or extra ball (Bowl a Strike; earning this extra ball resets the 10 strikes sequence). Only one top lane, upper left/right stnaudp target, or side saucer is lit at a time; these alternate every time a single point is scored from something other than the center rollover buttons. Top lanes and upper left/right standups score 100, while side saucers score 50.</p>

<p>Unlight all 10 center rollover buttons to score a Spare; after 3 Spares, any further Spare scores a Special (Lucky Strike) or an extra ball (Bowl a Strike).</p>

<p>To play for points instead of extra balls/Specials, try to hit the green standup target just above the center pop bumper. Hitting this target lights the red pop bumpers for 10 points instead of 1 and lights the kickers behind the flippers for 50 points instead of 5 for the rest of the current ball. These help boost your actual pinball score dramatically.</p>

<p>Tilt ends game. There is no end of ball bonus. Out lanes score 100 points when not lit for Special. There is no way to earn an extra ball on Lucky Strike and no way to earn a free game on Bowl a Strike. To my knowledge, Special and extra ball can never be set to score points.</p>
