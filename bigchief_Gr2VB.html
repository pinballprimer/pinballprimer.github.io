<h2>Game rules</h2>

<p>The side walls that form the top lanes funnel, the side wall above and slightly left of the left green pop bumper, and the rollover button directly above the right flipper rotate the wheel in the top left of the game by one position. The wheel can point at green, yellow, red, or white.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>When green is lit:</i> the left top lane, green rollover button, and left out lane are lit for 100 points instead of 10. The left slingshot and green pop bumper are lit for 10 points instead of 1. The upper left side lane, which always scores 10 points, is lit to open the Bottom Gate in the right out lane, which feeds the shooter lane for a replunge.</li>
	<li><i>When yellow is lit:</i> the right top lane, yellow rollover button, and right out lane are lit for 100 points instead of 10. The right slingshot and yellow pop bumper are lit for 10 points instead of 1.</li>
	<li><i>When red is lit:</i> the center top lane, red rollover button, and upper right standup target are lit for 100 points instead of 10. The red pop bumper is lit for 10 points instead of 1. The lower left standup target is lit for 500 points instead of 50. <b>As well, all green and yellow features are lit when Red is selected.</b></li>
	<li><i>When white is lit:</i> the upper right side lane is lit for Special instead of 100 points. <b>As well, all green, yellow, and red features are lit when White is selected.</li>
</ul>

<p>The center standup targets labelled A and B can be hit at any time. They score 10 points, and hitting an unlit target lights it. Light both targets to open the Top Gate in the middle right for a replunge.</p>

<p>Special can be set to award an extra ball instead of a free game. It cannot be set to be worth points. There is no end of ball bonus. Tilt ends the ball in play only.</p>
