<h1>Joust (Bally, 1969)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with the head-to-head solid state game Joust (Williams, 1983).</p>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>You should be able to shoot the center lane and make it to the bagatelle bonus area with either flipper. If you can, do so. If the right flipper is not able to backhand its way all the way up into the bagatelle area, shoot to the left side of the playfield with the goal of riding up the left wall and hitting the white mushroom bumper to zip the flippers together.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>The top saucer always scores 1,000 points, but it only lights the #5 for you if the ball bounces off the rubber wall switch below + to the right of the saucer. The saucer will only be lit to spot #5 until a 100-point switch is scored anywhere in the game.</p>

<h3>Collecting numbers</h3>

<p>The main goal of Joust is to collect the numbers 1 through 9. If you collect 1 through 6, you are awarded 3,000 points in end of ball bonus. If you collect 7 through 9, you get a 5,000 point end of ball bonus. If you collect all of 1 through 9, you get a 10,000 point end of ball bonus; or, if you <i>leave</i> the bagatelle bonus area with all 9 numbers lit, you score 10,000 points and all the numbers reset so you can work on a second set within a single ball. All numbers are reset when a ball ends.</p>

<p>#5 can be collected from the top saucer when it is lit from a skill shot. The white mushroom bumper scores 1,000 points and lights #4. The left yellow mushroom bumper scores 1,000 points and lights #6. The center red mushroom bumper scores 1,000 points and lights #1. The right yellow mushroom bumper scores 1,000 points and lights #2.<br>All 9 numbers can be collected from the bagatelle bonus area. There are three rows of rollover buttons; rolling over a lit one collects the corresponding number, but scores no points. The ball is guaranteed to roll over at least one button in each row, but can sometimes hit two if it gets some sideways momentum. The buttons are ordered as 1-9-2 in the top row, 6-8-7 in the middle row, and 3-4-5 in the bottom row.</p>

<p>Collecting numbers 1 and 2 lights the rollover button near the right slingshot to open the gate in the right out lane, which redirects the ball back to the shooter lane for a replunge.</p>

<h3>Pop bumpers</h3>

<p>The two upper yellow pop bumpers always score 10 points, and the lower red pop bumper always scores 100 points.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table and zipper flippers</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes. Flippers back up directly to the slingshots, which are angled more shallowly than usual. Two inch mini flippers are used. The white mushroom bumper in the top left of the game zips the flippers together, completely blocking off the center drain as a reward. The flippers are reopened by hitting either yellow mushroom bumper or by leaving the bagatelle bonus area. Slingshots score 1 point.</p>

<p>The left out lane is very tall and can be entered in two places: one just above the left slingshot, scoring 500 points, and one about halfway up the table, scoring a total of 1,500 points. Once the ball is in any part of the out lane, there is no way to save it from draining. The right out lane scores 500 points and has a gate that redirects the ball back to the shooter lane if numbers 1 and 2 have been collected.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus other than the rewards for lighting all of 1-6, 7-9, or both. There is also no way to score an extra ball; the Same Player Shoots Again light is just used to indicate that a player who used the right out lane gate to earn a replunge is continuing their turn.</p>
