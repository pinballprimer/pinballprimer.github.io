<h2>Game rules</h2>

<p>Collect Expressway letters in order by hitting lit mushroom bumpers and standup targets. All targets that can give a letter score 100 points. E-X-P are the mushroom bumpers at the top of the game, R-E are the left standup targets, S-S are the right standup targets, and W-A-Y are the center mushroom bumpers. Progress on spelling Expressway carries over from ball to ball. The lowermost standup target on the left scores 100 points and can be lit for Spot Letter; this target is always lit in a 3-ball game, but only lit 1/5 of the time in a 5-ball game based on 10-point switch hits. Spelling Express or Expressway (depending on settings) lights the Specials. Specials always score a free game and are lit at the upper left and upper right side lanes; depending on game settings, the lanes can be lit together or alternately based on 10-point switch hits.</p>

<p>Mileage Score is the game's bonus. It is advanced 1,000 points at a time by making the top saucer or hitting the W or Y mushroom bumpers in the center of the table. The bonus is only collected by shooting the right saucer or by draining down a lit out lane. The right saucer can be accessed from below via a direct flipper shot, or from above via the upper right side lane. Out lanes alternate being lit based on 10-point switch hits. If you are concerned only with score, building and collecting the Mileage Bonus as much as possible is the order of the day.</p>

<p>The upper left side lane scores 3,000 points and kicks the ball upward. The upper right side lane scores 2,000 points and feeds the right saucer. Both upper side lanes are lit for Special, either together or alternating, once either Express or Expressway is spelled. A Special always scores a free game; it cannot be set to score an extra ball and is worth 0 points. On a well-adjusted and maintained Expressway, the kicker in the upper left side lane should send the ball horizontally above the pop bumpers and down the upper right side lane.</p>

<p>Pop bumpers score 10 points or 100 when lit and are lit alternately based on 10-point switch hits.</p>

<p>The center post between the flippers is raised by making the top saucer or shooting the red mushroom bumper in the center of the table. It is lowered by pressing either of the Down Post rollover buttons near the flippers, or whenever the ball drains down an out lane.</p>
