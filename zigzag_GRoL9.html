<h1>Zig Zag / Wing Ding (Williams, 1964)</h1>

<p>Zig Zag is the replay version. Wing Ding is the add-a-ball version.</p>

<h2>Game rules</h2>

<p>Balls can be racked at the center top lane, far out lanes, and any saucer with a lit white insert. On Zig Zag, racking 9 balls lights the center saucer for Special. On Wing Ding, racking 9 balls resets the 9 balls and scores 1 extra ball. Racking a ball rotates which of the three saucers across the middle of the table is/are lit for additional score and/or to rack the next ball. The center top lane alternates being lit based on 1-point switch hits, and scores 10 points when not lit. If the inside of a saucer is lit, it scores 100 points instead of 50.</p>

<p>The first, second, fourth, and fifth top lanes score 100 points and award the letters A-B-C-D. Make a lit lane to unlight it. On Zig Zag, completing A-B-C-D lights the near out lanes alternately for Special. On Wing Ding, completing A-B-C-D scores 1 extra ball and lights both near out lanes for 300 points.</p>

<p>The center yellow bumper is always lit and always scores 1 point. Red bumpers and slingshots score 1 point, or 10 when lit. Pressing either of the On Red Bumpers And Kickers rollover buttons just above the pop bumpers will light the red bumpers and the slingshots for the rest of the ball only.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus. On Zig Zag, tilt ends game. I have not verified what the tilt penalty is on Wing Ding.</p>
