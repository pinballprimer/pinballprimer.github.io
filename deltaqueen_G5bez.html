<h1>Delta Queen (Bally, 1974)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>From the left flipper, shoot the right orbit to earn up to 3 bonus advances. From the right flipper, shoot the upper left saucer to collect the bonus; collecting the bonus does NOT reset it. Collecting A and B from the center standup targets awards double bonus. Bonus collects at the left saucer do get doubled if double bonus is lit. The left saucer, then, can be worth up to 20,000 points that can be collected repeatedly. A and B are dangerous shots; to minimize risk, try backhanding them. Extra balls and Specials light at the center saucer or top center lane when base bonus is maxed at 10,000.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>On the plunge</h3>

<p>A plunged ball can go through any of the three top lanes, or come down the right orbit. Top lanes always score 1,000 points; the left top lane lights the right bumper, and the right top lane lights the left bumper. The center top lane lights both bumpers, and if the base bonus is maxed out at 10,000 points, the center top lane also alternates being lit for Special or being lit for Extra Ball every time a 10-point switch is scored. Bumpers score 10 points or 100 when lit; the center bumper is always lit. Bumpers reset at the end of each ball.</p>

<h3>Right orbit</h3>

<p>Contains 3 rollover buttons that each score 100 points and a bonus advance. This shot is by far the safest and most efficient way to advance the bonus.</p>

<h3>Upper left saucer</h3>

<p>The left saucer always scores the entire bonus, including the 2x multiplier if Double Bonus has been lit. Collecting the bonus does not reset the value. This is a wide and relatively easy shot worth up to 20,000 points that can be collected infinitely. Be sure to master both the shot itself and how to get control of the return feed; balls rolling down this left lane should generally fall to the left flipper, where a dead bounce or catch + post transfer can move the ball to the right flipper for another shot at the bonus collect. Winners/high scores on Delta Queen are determined exclusively by how many times the left saucer can be scored at moderate-to-high value.</p>

<h3>Center saucer</h3>

<p>The center saucer scores 5,000 points when lit white, or 500 when not lit white; the white light alternates any time a 10-point switch is scored anywhere in the game. If the base bonus is maxed at 10,000 points, the center saucer will be lit either orange for Extra Ball or red for Special, alternating between those two any time a 10-point switch is scored.</p>

<h3>Center standup targets</h3>

<p>Score 500 points. Hit a lit target to collect its A or B letter. Collect both letters to light Double Bonus, which applies to both the end of ball bonus and any mid-ball bonus collects scored at the left saucer.</p>

<h3>Left and right standup targets</h3>

<p>Score 1,000 points and a bonus advance. Not worth shooting for directly; the slingshots may send the ball into these targets once in a while, but from the flippers, always be aiming for the right orbit or the left saucer lane instead.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Delta Queen has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes score 1,000 points and a bonus advance. Out lanes just score 1,000 points.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Base bonus is advanced by right orbit rollover buttons, in lanes, or the left and right standup targets. Bonus is doubled by collecting A and B from the center standup targets. Max bonus is 2x 10,000 = 20,000 points. The full bonus value can be collected at any time from the left saucer without being reset. Draining the ball always resets the bonus to 1,000 points and turns off the Double Bonus light.</p>

<h3>Final notes</h3>

<p>In Credit mode, Special scores a free game, Extra Ball scores an extra ball with a maximum of 1 extra ball per ball in play, and beating the replay score earns a free game. In add-a-ball mode, Special, Extra Ball, and replay scores all score an extra ball, with multiple extra balls allowed up to a maximum of 9 remaining balls to play for the game. In novelty mode, Special and Extra Ball score 5,000 points, and there is no reward for beating the listed replay score.</p>

<p>Tilt ends game.</p>
