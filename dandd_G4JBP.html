<h1 style="color:blue;">Dungeons and Dragons (Bally, 1987)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Bonus carries over throughout the whole game, so early on, focus on shooting light red, yellow, and blue standups. Follow the lit arrows to reset the lights on each bank. The upper flipper shot increases playfield multiplier and starts multiball if any balls are locked. If the upper right in line drops are completed after the yellow ball is locked, shooting that loop then comboing the upper flipper shot scores 1,000,000 points.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>The skill shot is a plunge with precise power. The goal is to have the ball roll up and then back down the ramp, as opposed to rolling up the ramp, through the small hidden tunnel, and down the habitrail. If the ball hits both switches on the left and then comes back down on the left, 100,000 points are scored. <br>Any hit to any switch on this ramp, even a failed skill shot, will relight the red targets if all of them are unlit (meaning Restore Sword is lit). </p>

<p>Multiball cannot be started off a plunge/skill shot, despite being the shot that starts multiball all other times.</p>

<h3>Bonus flame</h3>

<p>The red, yellow, and blue standup targets around the playfield correspond to Sword, Dust, and Shield, respectively. Hitting any lit target fends off the dragon's flame by un-lighting the smallest number diamond on the playfield. Lit targets score 5,000 points, unlit targets score 3,000 points, and completing a set of targets scores an additional 5,000 points.</p>

<p>The bonus count at the end of the ball is equal to the sum of the values of all unlit diamonds on the playfield. Hitting 7 lit targets, for example, scores 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28,000 in bonus. The sum of all 20 lights is 210,000 points.<br>Completing the dragon's flame once lights 2X Flame, meaning that at the end of the ball, two full completions of the flame are added to the value of the in progress one, effectively serving as a 420,000 point super bonus. Completing a second dragon's flame lights 3X Flame, which adds three flames (630,000 points) to the end of ball bonus. Completing a third dragon's flame lights both 2X and 3X Flame at once, signifying 5X flame, or a 1,050,000 point bonus. A fourth completion of the flames does not reset them, and instead maxes out the bonus at 1,260,000.</p>

<p>When all targets of one colour have been unlit, an arrow nearby will be lit for Restore. The first switch of the left ramp, the yellow teleport, or the blue teleport must then be shot to relight the red Sword, the yellow Dust, or the blue Shield targets respectively. Alternatively, the hidden lane to the right of the bottom bumper is lit for Restore All Weapons whenever any of the three banks is compeltely unlit, and is most easily collected by a rebound off the lower bumper or making the right Dragon's Lair saucer.</p>

<p>All bonus count, including the lit multipliers and the current flame in progress, is carried from ball to ball.</p>

<p>Making either Dragon's Lair saucer in the back of the game scores the value of the current flame in progress, but not any completed flames, meaning the award maxes out at 210,000 and is pitifully small if an early flame that causes the lights to relight was just completed.</p>

<h3>Teleport lanes</h3>

<p>If no balls are locked, shooting either teleport lane will lock a ball. However, the rules toward filling both locks at once are more nuanced.<br>If three ball multiball has not been played yet, the second lock will immediately work. However, if a three ball multiball has been played, shooting the second teleport lock will instead kick the first lock back out, and it will need to be relocked from the lane where it was just kicked out. Every time a three ball multiball is played, there will be one more kickout before both balls will stay locked at the same time.</p>

<p>If a two ball multiball is started during the sequence to qualify three ball multiball, the number of kickouts is saved. For example, to start 3-ball multiball for the third time, the first ball needs to be locked, then the second ball needs to be "locked" three times. If the second ball is "locked"/kicked out once, then a two ball multiball is started with the first lock, then once that multiball ends and ball 1 is locked again, it will only take 2 more shots to the lit teleport before ball 2 stays locked.</p>

<h3>Dragon's Lairs</h3>

<p>The Dragon's Lairs are two saucers in the very back of the game, on either side of the top bumper. They cannot be shot for directly. Making either Lair scores the value of the current flame in progress and kicks the ball out through the appropriate wire trail. If the left saucer is made when there is a ball in the blue lock, or if the right saucer is made when there is a ball in the yellow lock, a two ball multiball will begin and that ball will be kicked out.</p>

<p>The right side Lair spits the ball into a hidden lane that feeds the upper flipper. This is the Restore All Weapons lane, and resets any banks of the red/yellow/blue targets that have been completed.</p>

<h3>Right ramp, bell tower, and Mystical Million</h3>

<p>When a ball is locked in the yellow lock on the right, the shot becomes a ramp that leads to three in line drop targets that score 10,000 - 25,000 - 50,000 points, in order. Once all are down, the full upper right loop can be shot, which scores 100,000 points and qualifies the Mystical Million. At this point, the ball comes back down that right ramp and onto the upper flipper. If the ball is one-timed up and all the way around the left side ramp, 1,000,000 points are scored. This shot is only lit for about three seconds, so you only get one try, but the in line drop targets stay down for the rest of the ball, so any shot all the way up this right ramp is another chance at the Million, whether it's been collected already or not. </p>

<p>If the yellow targets have been exhausted and Restore Dust is lit while the right ramp is down (meaning the teleport is unavailable), the "next shot" to this ramp is needed to relight the yellow targets, which is the next drop target if there are any left or a full shot to the back switch if all targets are down.</p>

<p>An extra ball is available if two shots to this area of the table can be made in quick succession. On ball 1, the extra ball lights when the last drop target is hit, and is collected by qualifying the Million. On ball 2, the extra ball lights when the second drop target is hit, and collected by making the last drop target. On ball 3 (and on, if playing 5 ball), the extra ball is lit when the first drop target is hit, and collected by making the second. The extra ball is only lit for about 10 seconds before the opportunity is lost.</p>

<p>The drop targets reset between balls.</p>

<h3>Left side ramp</h3>

<p>This can only be shot from the upper flipper. Everything described below in this section only works outside of the skill shot, i.e., the "100K" light above this ramp is off.</p>

<p>Shooting this ramp at any time advances the Dungeon Level, which is a playfield multiplier. Each shot up the ramp and all the way around increases the playfield multiplier by 1X, up to a maximum of 5X, for 20 seconds. The dungeon level does not immediately reset after that time, but will instead decrease by one level every 20 seconds until it is back to 1X or the side ramp is hit again.<br>Shooting the side ramp when any balls are locked (one or both) immediately spits them out and starts multiball. This is the only way to begin three-ball multiball.<br>When Mystical Million is lit, it is collected by a shot to this ramp (see the previous section).</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>The flipper positions and slingshots are mostly normal, but there is only one lane on either side, with clear plastic reading Magic Save just above the flipper. These lanes serve as both in lanes and out lanes. There are additional buttons on the side of the cabinet next to the flipper buttons that operate this Magic Save, which pops up a small rail that closes off the gap and allows the lane to feed the ball to the flipper. It can be triggered at any time, lasts for about a second and a half, and then also has a cooldown of about a second before it can be used again. Dexterity and reaction time are required to operate these effectively given how quickly the ball can sometimes move in this game. <br>Don't use the Magic Save needlessly, as every 10 uses will decrease the amount of time it stays closed by 1/6 of a second, down to a minimum of 5/6 of one second.</p>

<p>When the star rollovers in these lanes are flashing, the Auto Save is on, meaning the Magic Save will pop up automatically. The auto save is always on until the player's score reaches at least 200,000, and is also on during multiball. Outside of these two situations, a single Auto Save can be earned on the left side by completing the Shield targets and on the right side by completing the Dust targets.<br>The Magic Save can still be manually used, even when the Auto Save is on. Doing so when a single-use Auto Save is lit can prevent that Auto Save from being used up if done quickly enough. It's generally good practice to use the manual Magic Save when the single-use Auto Save is on, just to keep the Auto around for when it's really needed, but don't use the manual save if one of the semi-permanent Auto Saves is running, or you'll just be making progress toward shortening future manual Magic Save timers. <br>It is possible for the ball to go through the lane so fast that even the auto saver does not react in time and the ball is lost; there is no compensation for this occurring.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>The timer for each level of the Dungeon Level playfield multiplier can be set to 10, 20, 40, or 60 seconds (default 20).<br>The red, yellow, and blue target process can be carried over or reset between balls (carried over by default).<br>The extra ball timer can be 4, 6, 10, or 16 seconds (10 is default).<br>The score threshold at which the permanent auto saver is turned off can be 0, 100,000, 200,000, or 300,000 points (default 200,000).<br>The amount of time that the Magic Save stays closed after being manually triggered at the beginning of the game can be set to any value between 5/6 of a second and 2 full seconds, in increments of 1/6 of a second. The number of manual Magic Save activations it takes for the timer to become shorter can be set to any even number between 6 and 20 inclusive.<br>Locked balls can be ejected at the end of the game or retained between games.<br>The permanent Auto Save during multiball can be disabled.<br>Special and extra ball cannot be set to be worth points; there are always a free game and an extra ball respectively unless disabled outright.</p>
