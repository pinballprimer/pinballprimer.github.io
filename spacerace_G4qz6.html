<h1>Space Race (Recel, 1977)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Shoot drop targets all day for 5,000 points and a bonus advance each. Completing one or both sets of drops (depending on settings) lights the center standup target of the completed bank(s) for double bonus and lights the corresponding top lane for extra ball. Hitting a target lit for double bonus resets the drops. Even after bonus is maxed at 2x 100,000, continue to shoot drop targets as much as possible.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Drop targets and Rocket features</h3>

<p>Each drop target down in either bank scores 5,000 points and a bonus advance (or 2 bonus advances, on very easy settings). Remember that despite this game having electronic sounds, it is still an electromechanical game; if you hit two drop targets at once, only one of them will be scored. Luckily, this game's score motor works quickly enough that if you ricochet from one drop target bank into another, you'll likely get credit for both.</p>

<p>Behind each 5-bank of drop targets is a 5-bank of standup targets. Standup targets score 500 points each. On easy settings, completing one bank of drop targets will light the exposed center standup target for double bonus, and will also light the corresponding top lane (left or right) for extra ball. On hard settings, you must complete both banks of drop targets first, then double bonus and extra ball will be lit on both sides at once. Hitting a standup target lit for double bonus will reset all drop targets and unlight the top lane extra balls.</p>

<p>Each individual drop target corresponds to a lane or standup target around the playfield. For the 5-bank of left drops, starting at the top and working down (i.e. going from right to left): the first target lights the left top lane, the second target lights the top left corner standup target, the third target lights the side lane behind the 5-bank, and the two lowest targets light the two left in lanes. The drop targets in the right 5-bank light the corresponding features on the right half of the table. Any of these "rocket" rollover lanes or standup targets will score 500 points when not lit, or 5,000 points and a bonus advance when lit. Resetting the drop targets by hitting a standup target lit for double bonus will unlight all of the rockets around the playfield.</p>

<h3>Circling the Space Station </h3>

<p>The Space Station on the playfield features 10 lights. Any time 100 points is scored, the light moves one position anticlockwise. (Scoring 500 points moves the light 5 positions.) If the light is in the 10th position, located directly up from the hinge of the left flipper, both out lanes will be lit for a Special. If the light is advanced past this position, 1 bonus advance is scored.<br>Pop bumpers and the wall switches above the out lanes score 100 points. The standup targets behind the drops and any unlit Rocket scores 500 points. The exact position of the light is preserved from ball to ball, so sometimes it may be slightly easier or harder than average to earn your first bonus advance in this way (since so many things give 500 points, though, the difference is effectively trivial).</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Space Race has a conventional in/out lane setup, but with a second in lane instead of a slingshot on both sides. All 4 in lanes are Rockets, which score 500 points when not lit or 5,000 and a bonus advance when lit. In lane Rockets are lit by shooting the drop targets that are closest to the bottom of the table on each side. Out lanes score 10,000 points and are lit for Special after every 10th 100-point switch is scored anywhere in the game.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by any lit Rocket, by every 10th 100-point switch, or by any drop target. (Drop targets can award 2 bonus advances instead of 1.) Each bonus advance is worth 10,000 points in end of ball bonus. Double bonus is scored by completing one or both drop target banks, then hitting the center standup target in one of the 5-banks when lit. Max bonus is 2x 100,000 = 200,000 points. There is no mid-ball bonus collect, and no portion of the bonus can be carried from ball to ball.</p>

<p>Maximum one extra ball per ball in play. Tilt ends the ball in play only.</p>
