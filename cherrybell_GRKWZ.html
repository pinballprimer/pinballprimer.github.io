<h1>Cherry Bell (Segasa Sonic, 1978)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Plunge the center top lane to light double bonus at the collect hole at the right. Making the left saucer in the center alcove to light triple outhole bonus. Once both bonus multipliers are lit, shoot the left orbit to build the bonus until it is maxed out. From here, consider what your current score is relative to your target; collecting the bonus at the right saucer and draining immediately afterward before being able to build the bonus back up again may result in getting fewer points than keeping a high bonus, picking up miscellaneous points around the playfield, and draining for full triple value.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>The left top lane scores 500 points and lights the pop bumpers. Bumpers score 100 points, or 1,000 when lit. Hitting either green standup target near the bumpers scores 1,000 points and turns the bumpers off.<br>The center top lane scores 5,000 points and lights Double Bonus when lit; the center top lane alternates being lit or not anytime a 500 or 5,000 point target is hit anywhere in the game. Double bonus only applies to bonus collects at the right saucer, not to the end of ball bonus collect at the out hole.<br>The right top lane scores 500 points and one bonus advance.</p>

<h3>Center saucers</h3>

<p>The center alcove has 3 different saucers that all score 5,000 points. Making a saucer lights that column. Making all of the columns associated with an award grants that award for the rest of the ball.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Left column only - cherry - lights Triple Bonus, which only applies to the end of ball bonus collect</li>
	<li>Right column only - bell - lights Extra Ball, which alternates between the left out lane and the near right out lane each time a 500 or 5,000-point switch is scored</li>
	<li>Left and center columns - oranges - Up Post, which raises a post that partially (but not completely) blocks the entrance to the right out lanes</li>
	<li>Center and right columns - grapes - lights the yellow standup targets on the sides of the game for 10,000 points instead of 1,000. Not worth shooting for, even when lit, because they add too much horizontal momentum to the ball, putting it out of control</li>
	<li>All three columns - BAR - lights the red standup targets on the sides of the games alternately for Special, switching sides each time a 500- or 5,000-point switch is scored</li>
</ul>

<h3>Building and collecting bonus</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by the left orbit, the right top lane, the star rollovers in the center of the playfield, the left in lane, and the right out lane. Each bonus advance is worth 10,000 points in base bonus. Bonus can be collected at any time by shooting the right saucer; collecting the bonus in this way resets it back to its base value of 10,000 points, but preserves any earned multipliers. Double Bonus is earned by making the center top lane when lit; this Double Bonus <i>only</i> applies to collects at the right saucer, not to the end of ball bonus. Triple Bonus is earned by making the left saucer in the center alcove; this Triple Bonus <i>only</i> applies to the bonus countdown at the end of the ball, not to any collects at the right saucer.</p>

<p>As a result of these rules, Cherry Bell becomes a bit of a risk-reward game. If you don't have any bonus multipliers, collect the bonus at the right saucer so you can build it back up- there's nothing to lose. But if you have Double Bonus and Triple Bonus lit with a max base bonus of 100,000 points, consider: the collect bonus saucer will give you 2x 100,000 = 200,000 points and let you keep your ball, while the end of ball bonus is worth 300,000 points instead at the cost of your turn. If you use the bonus collect saucer to take the 200,000 but are not able to rebuild the bonus before draining, you may have lost points compared to if you had taken the 300,000 end-of-ball collect. Intentionally draining with max triple bonus is usually not the strategy unless it guarantees you to win a multiplayer game, but with max triple bonus you may wish to avoid the collect saucer, earn additional miscellaneous points from center saucers/top lanes/bumpers, and take the 300,000-point sure thing on the way out. This decision hinges on your confidence at rebuilding the bonus and the difficulty of the table (especially the controllability of the bonus collect saucer's kickout).</p>

<p>If the base bonus is maxed out at 100,000 points, the left orbit scores 3,000 and star rollovers score 1,000.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>The left side of the table bottom is conventional; one in lane, worth 500 points and a bonus advance, and one out lane, which scores 5,000 points and is lit alternately for extra ball if the right column has been lit at the center alcove saucers. On the right side, there is no in lane; the flipper backs up directly to the right slingshot, which is significantly larger than the left one. The right out lane splits into two lanes underneath the slingshot; the near right out lane scores 5,000 points and is lit alternately for extra ball, while the far right out lane scores 500 points and a bonus advance. Lighting the left and center columns at the alcove raises a rubber post that mostly, but not completely, blocks the entrance to the right out lanes; with good nudge timing, a raised right post makes the right side of the table bottom very safe.</p>

<h3>Settings notes</h3>

<p>The Specials at the red standup target can be lit together instead of alternating when a 500- or 5,000-point switch is scored. There does not seem to be an equivalent setting for Extra Ball; the Extra Ball will always alternate between the two.</p>

<p>Special can be set to award a free game or an extra ball. There is a maximum of 1 extra ball per ball in play. The game manual indicates that if Special is set to extra ball, the Number Match at the end of the game will also award extra balls, but I have no idea how that would work in practice...does everyone who matched get an additional ball? Regardless, the Number Match can be disabled outright via a separate setting, just to be safe.</p>
