<h1>Space Jam (Sega, 1996)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>The best points in the game come from standard multiball, which is qualified by shooting the center Jump Ball ramp a lot (3 shots the first time, 6 the second time, etc). In multiball, follow the lit jackpots: left and right ramps, then orbits and center ramp, then captive ball, then right ramp -> top standup target. To play through game progression, shoot everything else on the table in single ball play- 3 captive balls, 4 shots to each orbit, 4 right ramps, both lower standup target banks, pop bumpers, and bottom lanes- in addition to getting a captive ball super jackpot in multiball.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>The skill shot is a precise-power plunge that gets the ball to go through the basketball hoop near the shooter lane. Use the flippers to choose which reward you would like from a successful skill shot: 300,000 points, Light Lock, Wabbit Hole, or Super Pops. A successful skill shot awards 1 basketball point in addition to the selected award. If the game settings allow for the ball to be plunged by pressing both flippers at once, doing so will always give credit for a successful skill shot, even if the pinball doesn't go through the basketball hoop.</p>

<p>After a successful skill shot, immediately shoot the ball up the left ramp and into the big basketball hoop for 10 basketball points. I believe this also scores 300,000 pinball points.</p>

<h3>Locks and multiball</h3>

<p>Shoot the Jump Ball center ramp (with the basketball on it) repeatedly to advance toward multiball. For the first multiball, it takes 1 ramp shot to light all 3 locks at once. For the second multiball, it takes 1 shot to light each lock. For the third multiball, it takes 2 shots to light each lock. I am not sure if multiball gets harder to start after the 3rd time. As soon as 3 balls are locked, multiball begins. The Jump Ball ramp should always be able to be shot from either flipper.</p>

<p>The jackpot value in multiball starts at 500,000 points and increases by 2,000 with every switch hit anywhere in the game. If the first jackpot made in phase 1 is the left Basket ramp, all jackpots are doubled, with each switch adding 4,000 to the jackpot instead. There are 4 phases to the jackpot progression.</p>
<ol>
	<li>The left Basket ramp and right ramp are lit for jackpots. The Basket is a double jackpot, which also doubles all jackpots for the rest of this trip through the progression. Collect either one to advance.</li>
	<li>The left orbit, center Jump Ball ramp, and right orbit are lit for jackpots. Collect all 3 to advance.</li>
	<li>Super Jackpot is lit at the captive ball, worth 3 times as much as the last jackpot earned in phase 2. Jackpot values cannot be raised from this point on. Collect 1 super jackpot to advance.</li>
	<li>Shoot the right ramp to light Super Duper Jackpot, which is available for 15 seconds at the standup target in the very back of the game, which requires a precise shot up the middle and through the bumpers. I am not sure how the Super Duper Jackpot is calculated; it's always at least 5,000,000 (or 10,000,000 if all jackpots were doubled), but it's not equal to 3x the Super Jackpot or 10x the normal Jackpot or the sum of all collected jackpots. Regardless, it's very valuable, and you should go for it. Collecting the Super Duper Jackpot resets the multiball progression to phase 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>A multiball restart is available at the center Jump Ball ramp for 15 seconds if multiball ends with no jackpots collected at all.</p>

<h3>Planets and associated modes</h3>

<p>Light all 7 planets to qualify Final Jam wizard mode. Each planet requires various shots to a certain feature in the game.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Super Jackpot:</b> play multiball and score a Super Jackpot from the captive ball as described above.</li>
	<li><b>Space Jam:</b> complete the standup targets in the lower left and right by hitting unlit targets to light all of the letters in Space Jam. When you complete Space Jam, you are awarded the planet and Super Jam immediately begins: this is a 45-second mode where all 6 major shots are lit with large red arrows. Make a shot to score the current shot value and unlight it. The first shot's value is 50,000 points; each subsequent shot is worth 100,000 more than the last, with the 6th and final shot scoring 550,000 points.</li>
	<li><b>Fire:</b> shoot the right ramp 4 times to spell Fire. Completing Fire awards the planet and starts On Fire, a 24-second mode where all shots to the left Basket ramp score 10 basketball points (and 200,000 pinball points, I think, but the game doesn't like to show you your pinball score while On Fire is running).</li>
	<li><b>In Yer Face:</b> this planet is awarded by making 3 hits to the captive ball during single ball play. Lighting this planet does not start any mode. This is separate from the In Yer Face mode, which is started by completing the drop targets at the top of the playfield; the In Yer Face mode does not need to be running for captive ball hits to count toward the In Yer Face planet.</li>
	<li><b>Rebounds:</b> every 30 pop bumper hits over the course of the game is a rebound threshold. Reach a rebound threshold to light this planet. Pop bumpers start the game worth 1,000 points; reaching a rebound threshold scores 100,000 times the number of thresholds reached in the game (maximum 900,000 points), then raises the pop bumper value by 1,000 points to a maximum of 10,000 per bumper. If Super Pops is running because of a skill shot or Wabbit Hole award, the pop bumper value is always 20,000 and cannot grow.</li>
	<li><b>Slam:</b> spell Slam at the bottom lanes by rolling through unlit lanes to light them. Flipper lane change can be used to rotate which lanes are lit. Spelling Slam once increases the bonus multiplier by 1x and lights this planet. Max bonus is 6x; completing the Slam lanes after 6x bonus lights the center Jump Ball ramp for extra ball the first time, and scores 200,000 points per completion after that.</li>
	<li><b>Fast Break:</b> shots to either orbit score 100,000 points. Consecutive shots to the same orbit each score 50,000 more than the previous one until you miss. Making 4 shots to each orbit starts Fast Break, a count-up mode. The count-up value starts at 200,000 points and counts up to 700,000; shoot the right ramp as many times as possible to repeatedly collect the count-up value.</li>
</ul>
<p>After all 7 planets are lit, shoot the left Basket ramp to start Final Jam wizard mode. This is a 5-ball multiball with unlimited ball save for 60 seconds. The left Basket ramp's value starts at 100,000 points, and any switch in the game increases that value by 10,000. Shoot the left ramp as many times as you can to repeatedly collect the value. Relocking a ball in either the Wabbit Hole or the center Jump Ball ramp doubles the value of the Final Jam award for 15 seconds; relocking balls in both of those locations will triple the value of the Final Jam award for 15 seconds. This mode can be worth a ton or points or absolutely nothing depending on your consistency with making baskets at the left ramp. Once the 60 seconds runs out, all balls are allowed to drain, and single ball play will restart with all planets unlit so they can be collected again.</p>

<h3>Wabbit Hole mystery award</h3>

<p>Hit the 2 and 3 post targets on either side of the right ramp to spell the number 23 and light the center scoop for a Wabbit Hole mystery award. You can also receive a Wabbit Hole award by selecting it as your skill shot. Bugs Bunny will randomly pick one of 3 awards taken from this list.</p>
<ul>
	<li>300,000 points</li>
	<li>1 on 1: one shot is lit at a time. Make the lit shot to score 200,000 points and light a new shot. The mode continues for 45 seconds or until all 6 shots have been made.</li>
	<li>Defense: a hurry-up is started. It begins at 450,000 points, decreases by 10,000 per second, and bottoms out at 100,000 points. Hit any drop target in the upper bank to lock in the current hurry-up value. If you do, you get 20 seconds where all 6 major shots in the game score the locked-in value. If you do not hit a drop target before the hurry-up runs out, the mode instantly ends.</li>
	<li>2 on 2: a 2-ball quick multiball. Shoot the center or right ramp to score 100,000 points and light the left ramp for 300,000 points for 10 seconds.</li>
	<li>Full Court Frenzy: a 5-ball quick multiball where all major shots score a frenzy value, which starts at 200,000 points and increases by 2,500 for each switch hit anywhere in the game. This can be surprisingly valuable.</li>
	<li>Video Mode: use the flippers to move the basketball hoop back and forth to catch as many shots from the Tune Stars as possible. You get 50,000 points for each caught shot, plus 200,000 bonus points for catching all 16.</li>
	<li>Trivia Game: use the flippers to answer a trivia question about Michael Jordan. I'm not sure on the point values for a right or wrong answer.</li>
	<li>...others?</li>
</ul>

<h3>In Yer Face mode</h3>

<p>Every odd-numbered completion of the top drop targets scores 100,000 points. Every even-numbered completion of the top drop targets starts In Yer Face mode, where you have 30 seconds to hit the captive ball 3 times for 200,000, then 300,000, then 400,000 points.</p>

<h3>Basketball points</h3>

<p>You receive 1 basketball point for making a skill shot, 2 for hitting the captive ball, 3 for making the left Basket ramp, or 10 for making the left Basket ramp when On Fire is running or as a super skill shot immediately after making a standard skill shot. At 23 basketball points, you receive 300,000 points; at 45 basketball points, extra ball is lit at the center Jump Ball ramp. I believe these awards loop every 45 basketball points, so you get another 300,000 pinball points at 68 basketball points, and another extra ball lit at 90 basketball points.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Space Jam has a conventional in/out lane setup. All lanes award letters in Slam; go through an unlit lane to light it, and use flipper lane change to rotate the locations of the lit lanes.</p>

<p>During multiball, after lighting or collecting the super jackpot, I have seen the display show the message "Special is lit at out lanes" but there is not actually a light that can show this in the out lanes and I have never actually gotten a playfield special from the out lanes.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is calculated as 10,000 points, plus an additional 10,000 for each orbit and ramp made on that ball, plus 30,000 for each currently lit planet, all multiplied by the bonus multiplier. Bonus multiplier is advanced one at a time by the Slam in/out lanes and maxes out at 6x. I do not know of any ways to collect the bonus mid-ball or hold the base bonus or multiplier from one ball to the next.</p>
