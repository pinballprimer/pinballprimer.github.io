<h1>Safari (Bally, 1968)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Surf 'n Safari (Premier Gottlieb, 1991).</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Ball control happens very rarely on Safari due to the number of bumpers around the playfield and the design of the table bottom. When you do get the ball on a flipper, aim for anything that scores at least 100 points- mushroom bumpers or the upper right side lane. Mushroom bumpers award letters in Tiger or Trail; completing a word awards one Super Score (which gives progress toward free games) and increases the upper right side lane value to 200.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>The wall switch on the right side of the "funnel" to the top lanes at the very top of the playfield lights the center top lane. The top lanes score 10 points; the center top lane scores 100 when lit. Hitting any 10-point switch anywhere around the playfield unlights the center top lane if it is lit.</p>

<h3>Full-size bumpers</h3>

<p>The three pop bumpers and the passive bumper between the flippers always score 10 points.</p>

<h3>Mushroom bumpers: spelling Tiger and Trail</h3>

<p>Mushroom bumpers score 100 points. Yellow mushroom bumpers spot letters in Tiger, while red mushroom bumpers spot letters in Trail. Spelling either Tiger or Trail awards one Super Score, lights one of the center out lanes, and advances the value of the upper right side lane from 100 to 200 points. If you spell both Tiger and Trail in one ball, the entire sequence resets so that more Super Scores can be earned; this includes unlighting the center out lanes and decreasing the value of the upper right lane from 200 back to 100 points.</p>

<p>Making the upper right lane at any time opens the gate in the right out lane. When the upper right lane is lit for 100 points, it will spot one letter in Trail. When the upper right lane is lit for 200 points, it will spot one letter in both Tiger and Trail.</p>

<p>Super Scores are indicated on the backglass by their own separate score reel for each player. This reel is yellow and counts up to 9. Any number of Super Scores between 3 and 9 inclusive can trigger an award depending on operator settings; a Super Score award can be 1 replay or 50 points.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Safari features 2-inch mini flippers that are quite far apart. Between the flippers are two center out lanes and one bumper. The bumper is always lit and scores 10 points, but on most copies of Safari, it is not a pop bumper; instead, it is a passive bumper that effectively acts as a very large center post. On either side of the bumper are center out lanes; these score 10 points or 100 when lit, and are lit whenever Tiger (left) or Trail (right) is fully spelled. There are no in lanes or slingshots. Out lanes score 50 points. The right out lane has a gate that returns the ball to the shooter lane; this gate is opened by making the upper right side lane and closes when it is used, when the ball drains, or when the game is tilted. There is no kickback or other save feature in the left out lane.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus. Tilt ends the ball in play only. A game can consist of 3, 5, or 7 balls.</p>

<h3>Add-a-ball mode</h3>

<p>A separately purchaseable modification for Safari introduces an add-a-ball mode to the game. As far as I have found, no game shipped from the Bally factory with this mod pre-installed, so it is purely an operator decision to use it. This modification allows the Super Score award to be an extra ball. Since this is a 2-player game, earned extra balls are likely subject to a maximum of 1 extra ball per ball in play.</p>
