<h1>Bugs Bunny's Birthday Ball (Bally Williams, 1990)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Looney Tunes (Spooky Pinball, 2024).</p>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>From the left flipper, always shoot the right orbit to get back to the top lanes and mini-playfield, especially if the ball just went through the left in lane, as the spinner will be lit for 50,000 per spin. From the right flipper, shoot the center ramp for a random award that could be worth 500,000 points or extra ball. On the mini-playfield, hit the lit target on the right 3-bank to increase the Tweety Slide value up to a max of 1,000,000 points, then shoot the exit to the mini-playfield in the lower left to score the value.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot: upper left target</h3>

<p>The skill shot is a timed plunge to the standup target in the upper left of the game, whose value flashes between 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, or 500,000 points plus a bonus multiplier. After the ball is plunged, the spinner in the right orbit rotates the value of the top standup between the first three values (500,000 + bonus multiplier is skill shot-exclusive).</p>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Roll through an unlit top lane to light it. Flipper lane change is available with both flippers, allowing lit lanes to be moved in either direction. Spelling Pop advances the bonus multiplier toward its maximum of 5x. Completions of Pop after the bonus multiplier is maxed out at 5x score 100,000 points each. After the ball goes through the top lanes, it will be dropped onto the mini-playfield.</p>

<h3>Mini-playfield</h3>

<p>The mini-playfield slopes from front to back, rather than back to front like the rest of the game. The single flipper on the mini-playfield is operated with the right flipper button.<br>The Tweety Slide value starts at 50,000 points. Hitting the lit target in the 3-bank on the right adds 50,000 to the Tweety Slide value, up to a maximum of 1,000,000 points. The lit target moves back and forth across the 3-bank automatically. The Tweety Slide value is scored by shooting the ball up the ramp at the bottom of the mini-playfield, which drops the ball in the right in lane of the main playfield. If the ball is "drained" on the mini-playfield, it will be launched up the bottom ramp to get the ball back to the main playfield, but this does not score the Tweety Slide value.<br>Hitting both of the 2-bank of standup targets on the left lights the captive ball for Big Score; the captive ball gets knocked back and forth between the mini-playfield and the main playfield. Any shot that transfers the captive ball relights the kickback in the main playfield left out lane; this scores 50,000 points when not lit or 500,000 when lit.</p>

<h3>Center ramp</h3>

<p>The center ramp scores a random value from Tazmanian Devil's Shopping List, which can be 50,000, 100,000, 250,000, or 500,000 points, or an extra ball. As far as I can tell, the award is random, and does not actually depend on how long the ball is in the swirling dish before dropping into the pop bumper area. When the ball is dropped in the bumpers, each bumper activation scores 1 bonus advance, but only until the ball leaves the bumpers. The ball usually leaves the bumpers at the bottom, but can be knocked onto the mini-playfield or back toward the top lanes.</p>

<h3>Right orbit and spinner</h3>

<p>The right orbit spinner lane leads back to the top lanes, which in turn feeds the mini-playfield. Each spin of the spinner rotates the value of the single standup target above the top lanes. The spinner scores 5,000 per spin when not lit, or 50,000 per spin when it; the spinner is lit for about 5 seconds after the ball goes through the left in lane. If the spinner spins well, this means a left in lane -> right orbit combo can score 1,000,000 points or more. This is the second half of the "vicious cycle" on Bugs Bunny: plunge to the mini-playfield, shoot the Tweety Slide which feeds the left in lane, shoot the Spinner because it's lit and gets the ball back to the mini-playfield, and repeat.</p>

<h3>Looney Tunes letters and drop targets</h3>

<p>The three banks of standup targets around the main playfield spell Looney Tunes. All letters start flashing; hit a flashing letter target to light it solidly. Flashing targets score 10,000 points, and lit targets score 1,000. Light all 11 letters solidly to light one of the Million targets for 1,000,000 points; the Million targets are in the lower left of the main playfield, or directly in front of the center ramp across from the NEY targets.</p>

<p>The drop targets each score 3,000 points and a bonus advance. When any drop target is knocked down, a 15-second timer starts; the bank will be reset when this timer expires, unless the bank is completed first. Completing the drop target bank spots a letter in Looney Tunes, resets the bank, and lights the outer two targets in the bank for 50,000 points for about 15 seconds. The 50,000 timer is independent of the bank reset timer.</p>

<h3>Center saucer</h3>

<p>The center saucer blows out a random number of candles between 1 and 9, and scores 10,000 points times the number of candles blown out. On the final ball of the game only, if you blow out all of the candles, a hurry-up begins where the ball is kicked out of the center saucer- if you shoot the ball back into the center saucer within 10 seconds, you score 50,000,000 points. This is a ridiculous amount of score, but the opportunity is given randomly- only 5% of last-ball center saucer shots start the 50,000,000 chance, so it's not worth going for at all, unless you're in a competitive game need to make up a gap of 10,000,000+ points in a hurry.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Bugs Bunny's Birthday Ball has a nearly-conventional in/out lane setup; instead of there being one in lane and one out lane on each side, the right side has no out lane, and the left side has 2 out lanes. The far left out lane has a kickback that is lit automatically at the start of each ball, unlights when used, and is relit by transferring the captive ball between the two playfields. The far left out lane scores 10,000 points; the near left out lane scores 100,000 points; the in lanes both score 3,000 points and a bonus advance. The left in lane also lights the spinner for 50,000 points per spin for a few seconds. The in/out lanes can also be lit for Extra Ball as a compensation feature on the final ball of a short game; this extra ball can be moved with flipper lane change. </p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by the top lanes, drop targets, and in lanes, or by any bumper hits that occur immediately after a center ramp shot. Bonus multiplier is advanced by completing the top lanes. Max bonus is 5x 100,000 = 500,000 points. There is no way to carry any part of the bonus over between balls and there is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>

<h3>Surprise Package</h3>

<p>At the end of the game, each player has a chance to keep a Surprise Package for themselves, or pass it to the next player. The Surprise Package can contain nothing, a -500,000 points penalty that turns out to be nothing because Bugs Bunny is "just kiddin'", 100,000 points, 500,000 points, an extra ball, and possibly other things. I have not encountered any reason not to take the Surprise Package for yourself at all times.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>The game manual indicates that Special scores 100,000 points in competition/novelty play, but I am not even sure how it's possible to score a playfield Special, so this may be a moot point. There is not a game setting that awards points in place of an extra ball.</p>

<p>Looney Tunes letters, lit Million targets, and lit extra balls can all independently be set to carry over between balls or not.</p>

<p>The Tweety Slide value can be reset between each ball. By default, it does not reset, and builds over the course of the game.</p>

<p>The drop target timer can be set to 10 seconds instead of 15.</p>

<p>The kickback in the far left out lane can be lit for free only at the start of the game, rather than being lit for free at the start of each ball. There is not a setting that allows the kickback state to be held in memory; if it is not lit at the start of each ball, it will always be off at the start of every ball other than ball 1.</p>

<p>The frequency at which the 50,000,000 chance is given by the center saucer can be set to anywhere between 1% and 25%. Default is 5%, and the factory-installed difficulty settings range from 3% to 7%.</p>
