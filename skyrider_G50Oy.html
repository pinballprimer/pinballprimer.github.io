<h1>Sky Rider / Hi-Flyer (Chicago Coin, 1974)</h1>

<p>Sky Rider is the 4-player version. Hi-Flyer is the 2-player version. The two versions have identical rules and scoring.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>At the start of every ball, shoot to the top of the table via the orbits to earn bonus advances from the top rollover buttons and top lanes. If you knock down all of the 1-2-3-4 drop targets along the way, pivot to shooting the center spinner for 1,000 per spin, but don't go out of your way for 1-2-3-4 unless bonus is maxed at 20,000. When you do start shooting the spinner, be sure not to hit the pop bumper behind it straight on, or else you run the risk of getting the ball dunked down the middle.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Advancing Bonus</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by the rollover buttons above the top lanes, the lit top lane itself, and either in lane. Max base bonus is 20,000 points. Double bonus is given for free on balls 3 and 5, and cannot be earned on any other ball. Shoot the very large orbit shots on either side of the playfield to get back to the top of the table for more bonus advances- end of ball bonus is the primary source of scoring in this game.</p>

<h3>1-2-3-4 drop targets and spinner</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 1,000 points. 1 and 2 are located behind the blue 100-point bumpers relative to the flippers, so they can't be shot directly; you basically need some pop bumper luck to catch the 1 and 2 targets when coming down from the top of the table. 3 and 4 are located in the lower left and right. Knocking down all 4 targets in one ball increases the value of the center spinner from 100 points per spin to 1,000 points per spin, and also lights both out lanes for extra ball.</p>

<p>When shooting the center spinner, take care to aim toward one side of the spinner, so that the ball going through the spinner does not hit the red 1,000 point bumper and get blasted down the middle of the table. At best, this has a chance to stop the spinner and lose you out on some points; at worst, this will cause the ball to center drain at light speed. Aiming to one side of the spinner will help ensure that the ball's contact with the red pop bumper is more of a glancing blow than a direct hit.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Sky Rider has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes score 1,000 points and a bonus advance. Out lanes score 1,000 points and are lit for Extra Ball by completing 1-2-3-4. The in lanes have a hard corner rather than being curved, so shatzing/alley passing to earn bonus advances is not effective.</p>

<p>See above for bonus and bonus multiplier rules. Maximum 1 extra ball per ball in play. Tilt ends the ball in play only.</p>
