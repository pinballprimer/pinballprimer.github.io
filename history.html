<h1>A (Not-So-Brief) History of Pinball</h1>

<br>

<h3>17th-19th centuries</h3>

<p>The game bagatelle is invented when people adapt tabletop versions of bowling and billiards into a game with fixed pins where holes in the board are fixed targets.</p>

<p><b>c. 1750:</b> Japanese billiards, or "billard japonais", is invented in France, with the first known instance of a spring loaded plunger, which is still frequently used today.</p>

<p><b>1869:</b> The spring launcher is patented in the USA by Montague Redgrave. His other innovations that moved bagatelle toward modern pinball include the use of bells in the game.</p>

<h3>1930s</h3>

<p><b>1931:</b> D. Gottlieb & Co., founded by David Gottlieb in 1927, releases Baffle Ball, the first coin operated pin ball game. It gave players 5 or 7 balls for 1 cent, and became a smash hit as cheap Great Depression entertainment, selling over 50,000 copies. It is considered the first true American pinball game.</p>

<p><b>1932:</b> Raymond Moloney, a distributor for Gottlieb, founded his own company out of frustration that he couldn't get more supply of Baffle Ball to sell. His company was Lion Manufacturing, and the game he designed and released was Ballyhoo, named after a popular magazine at the time. It sold just as well as Baffle Ball, and Lion Manufacturing was soon renamed Bally.</p>

<p><b>1933:</b> Pacific Amusements releases Contact, the first game to use a solenoid to kick the ball out of a bonus hole or ring a ball. This was the first use of electricity in a coin operated pin game. Contact was designed by Harry Williams, who would design games for various companies and eventually found his own company over the next half century.</p>

<p><b>1935:</b> After a boom following the success of Baffle Ball and Ballyhoo, only about a dozen pinball manufacturers are left, out of the 100+ that were in existence in 1932. Even fewer of those dozen will survive the Great Depression.</p>

<p><b>1936:</b> Pacent Novelty releases Bolo, followed shortly by Bally's release of Bumper. These are the first games to contain bumpers. While they are a far cry from the pop bumpers that are well-known today, they are still the first scoring feature that is not simply a hole for the ball to rest in worth a labelled number of points.</p>

<h3>1940s</h3>

<p><b>1941:</b> The USA enters World War II. Most pinball manufacturers cease production of pinball and donate the materials to the war effort; remaining games are generally re-themed in patriotic ways.</p>

<p><b>Early 1940s:</b> Fiorello LaGuardia bans pinball in New York City as part of a movement against organized crime. He declared that pinball games were gambling machines and raided establishments around the city, smashing the games with hammers and throwing the pieces in the Hudson River.</p>

<p><b>1944:</b> Harry Williams founds Williams Manufacturing as a new pinball company. They begin a rise to prominence after World War II ends.</p>

<p><b>1947:</b> Gottlieb releases Humpty Dumpty, the first game with flippers. There are three sets of the "player operated flipper bumpers", which point toward the sides of the table, and they are weak enough that it requires using all three sets to get to the top of the table again.</p>

<p><b>1948:</b> Genco releases Triple Action, the first game to include just two flippers at the bottom of the playfield, though they still face outward.</p>

<h3>1950s</h3>

<p><b>1950:</b> Gottlieb releases Just 21 and Spot Bowler, and Williams releases Lucky Inning. These three tables together are among the first to include two inward facing flippers at the bottom of the playfield, a now familiar design.</p>

<p><b>1953:</b> Williams releases Army Navy, the first game ever to track a player's score with an individual odometer-style score reel for each digit, rather than a single reel for the entire score or a series of lights that would illuminate behind numbers to show the score.</p>

<p><b>1954:</b> Gottlieb releases Super Jumbo, which is their first game with score reels in the style of Army Navy as well as the first game with flippers to support multiple players.</p>

<p><b>1956:</b> Bally releases Balls-a-Poppin', the first game to give multiball as a reward. Previous games only had "multiball" if a player intentionally loaded multiple balls to the plunger at a time.</p>

<h3>1960s</h3>

<p><b>1960:</b> Gottlieb releases Flipper, the first of their "wedge head" games, so named because of the trapezoidal shapes of their backboxes. This line of single player EM games helps push Gottlieb to the front of the pack in the 1960s and well into the 1970s.</p>

<p><b>1965:</b> Gottlieb releases Kings and Queens, a game which would go on to receive international attention in 1975 thanks to its feature in the movie <i>Tommy. Tommy</i> was a movie about a psychosomatically blind, deaf, and mute boy who became a master pinball player that could play by smell and feel; the movie itself was based on an album of the same name by British rock band The Who, and helped coin the phrase "pinball wizard".</p>

<p><b>1965:</b> Gottlieb releases the replay Bank-a-Ball and its add-a-ball cousin Flipper Pool, the first games to feature "flipper return lanes" now known as in lanes. The Italian bottom was born, and the out lane/in lane/slingshot setup with one flipper on each side would eventually become the norm in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

<p><b>1966:</b> Bally releases Bazaar, the first game with zipper flippers, which are a special type of flippers that can be rotated and moved inward to "zip" together and block off a center drain. Bally was the only company to use zipper flippers, and even more specifically they were rarely seen outside of the designs of Ted Zale; they began to disappear near Zale's retirement in the early 1970s, and have not been seen on any table from any manufacturer since Medusa (Bally, 1981).</p>

<p><b>1968:</b> Gottlieb releases Paul Bunyan and Big Jack, the last conventional pinball designed by Wayne Neyens before he was promoted to an executive role. Neyens designed nearly 200 pinball machines for Gottlieb in the 1940s-60s, including pioneering the "wedgehead" games that propelled Gottlieb to the top of the pinball market in the second half of the electromechanical era. He retired from Gottlieb in 1983 but had a long life after retirement, living to the age of 104 when he passed away in 2022.</p>

<p><b>1969:</b> Bally releases Bally Hoo, the first game to exclusively feature 3-inch "jumbo" flippers, which have since become standard in pinball.</p>

<p><b>1969:</b> Bally acquires Midway Manufacturing, an amusement and carnival game manufacturer. Midway would enter the arcade video game scene by helping publish Taito's Space Invaders in 1978 and would be formally merged with Bally's pinball division later on.</p>

<h3>1970s</h3>

<p><b>1970:</b> Gottlieb releases Snow Derby, the first game to include an end-of-ball bonus awarded to players after each of their turns end.</p>

<p><b>1971:</b> INDER of Madrid, Spain releases Hearts Gain, their first game. INDER would go on to become one of the largest and longest running pinball manufacturers outside of the United States.</p>

<p><b>1974:</b> Bally designs a solid state prototype of their game Flicker. While a solid state version of this game was never released to the public, it is still widely believed to be the first working pinball game ever made that uses microprocessors.</p>

<p><b>1974:</b> Zaccaria is founded in Bologna, Italy, releasing their first game, Strike. They will go on to become the premier pinball company in Europe for much of the 1970s and 80s.</p>

<p><b>1975:</b> Allied Games releases Rock On and Mirco Games releases The Spirit of 76, believed to be the first two solid state games to reach production. Neither sold particularly well, but the solid state era was officially underway. These early solid state games had electronic scoring and processing, but still used electromechanical chimes.</p>

<p><b>May 1976:</b> A young pinball enthusiast and writer for Gentleman's Quarterly magazine named Roger Sharpe testified in front of city council in Manhattan that pinball was a game of skill, not chance. Two machines were brought to the courtroom, a main and a backup, but the council demanded that Sharpe use the backup in case the first machine had been tampered with. The backup, and the one he did his demonstration on, was Gottlieb's Sure Shot. He predicted to the council that his plunge would end up in the middle lane out of the top set of 5, and then executed exactly as he predicted. The council unanimously overturned the ban on pinball for New York City, and many other cities followed suit. The events of this day were adapted into the 2021 documentary "Pinball: The Man Who Saved The Game".</p>

<p><b>October 1976:</b> Bally becomes the first major pinball manufacturer to enter the solid state era with the non-commercial home game Fireball. Their first commercial solid state game would be Freedom, released in December.</p>

<p><b>November 1976:</b> Atari joins the pinball industry and releases their first game, The Atarians. In addition to being known as a very early solid state game that put all player scores and info on the apron, The Atarians was also the first widebody solid state machine, the first game with solid state sounds instead of bells or chimes, and the first game to use under-playfield magnetic induction sensors to track the ball instead of standard rollover switches or buttons.</p>

<p><b>Late 1976:</b> Gottlieb is bought out by Columbia Pictures, retaining the Gottlieb name. This sharing of rights will eventually allow Gottlieb to make pinball games based on popular contemporary media, such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Charlie's Angels, and The Incredible Hulk.</p>

<p><b>1977:</b> Sam Stern, a previous part owner of Williams, and his son Gary purchase the assets of failing pinball veteran Chicago Coin, forming Stern Electronics. Their first game is a 2-player EM called Disco in June, followed by a game simply called Pinball that saw both electromechanical and solid state releases.</p>

<p><b>September 1977:</b> Williams enters the solid state era with their game Hot Tip.</p>

<p><b>September 1977:</b> Bally releases Eight Ball, the first game from a major manufacturer to be solid-state exclusive and not feature any electromechanical version. Eight Ball would go on to sell 20,230 units, a record for flipper pinball that would stand for more than fifteen years.</p>

<p><b>December 1977:</b> Gottlieb releases Cleopatra, their first solid state game, but they will continue to focus primarily on electromechanical pinball for the next year-plus. Gottlieb chose to prioritize the opinion of operators who did not want pinball to start looking and sounding like video games over the opinion of players who were excited by all the new things solid state machines could offer.</p>

<p><b>1978</b>: Atari releases Video Pinball, the first arcade game with simulated physics and the first ever virtual recreation of pinball.</p>

<p><b>February 1978:</b> Bally holds their first ever Super Shooter tournament in Chicago, Illinois, USA. The event was timed to coincide with the unveiling of their new Playboy game, and attracted hundreds of competitors from around the country. Top performers in the tournament won a new pinball machine and a new car. The Bally Super Shooter tournaments are often cited as the first nationwide pinball tournaments and are still among the largest turnouts ever by any pinball tournament.</p>

<p><b>June 1978:</b> Williams releases Disco Fever, the first game with curved "banana" flippers instead of the conventional flipper bats. Their original purpose was to appear and be in-theme on a scrapped 1977 pinball game about the sport of jai alai, where players use curved hooks to throw and catch balls. Williams had already bought and obtained the supply when that game was scrapped, so they forced banana flippers onto Disco Fever and 1979's Time Warp to use the supply, even though those games were not designed with the curved flippers in mind.</p>

<p><b>October 1978:</b> Williams releases Flash, the first game with constant background sound during gameplay and the first game with purely decorative flashing lights. With over 19,000 copies produced, Flash is still the third-best-selling flipper pinball game of all time as of 2026.</p>

<p><b>March 1979:</b> Gottlieb releases Solar Ride, T.K.O., and Space Walk, their last three electromechanical games. None of the three sold more than 400 units. They would be the final purely electromechanical games released by any major American manufacturer.</p>

<p><b>May 1979:</b> Atari releases Hercules, their final game to reach full production and the physically largest pinball ever invented. It is over 3 feet wide, 8 feet deep, and 7 feet tall, with pinballs the size of pool balls. It didn't sell well and didn't make nearly enough income to offset the production costs, so the new format was never really seen again.</p>

<p><b>December 1979:</b>  Williams releases Gorgar, the first game to feature synthesized speech. The title monster Gorgar can form rudimentary sentences by rearranging seven words. Bally and Williams had previously experimented with speech in prototypes of Kiss and Disco Fever respectively, but the feature did not make it to market until Gorgar.</p>

<h3>Early 1980s</h3>

<p><b>January 1980:</b> Stern Electronics releases Galaxy, the first pinball with computer-controlled general illumination, which allowed for much more extreme and attractive light shows.</p>

<p><b>February 1980:</b> Williams releases Firepower, the first solid state game with a multiball feature and the first game of any kind with Lane Change, allowing players to change which features are lit with the flipper buttons to make it easier to light all of them.</p>

<p><b>November 1980:</b> Williams releases Black Knight. In addition to being the first solid state game with a multi-level playfield, Black Knight also introduced the concepts of magna-save and bonus balls.</p>

<p><b>November 1980:</b> Bally releases Xenon, the first game to include speech recorded by a woman.</p>

<p><b>December 1980:</b> Gottlieb releases Asteroid Annie and the Aliens, the final pinball game from a major American manufacturer to be single player only for more than three decades.</p>

<p><b>October 1981:</b> Gottlieb releases Black Hole, the first game with a manufacturer recommendation of 50 cents per play.</p>

<p><b>February 1982:</b> Stern Electronics releases Orbitor-1. This is a very odd game with many magnets under the playfield and an uneven playfield shape designed to recall the craters of a moon or alien planet. It is looked back on only as a novelty, and a very difficult-to-play game. Orbitor-1 was the final game from Stern Electronics to reach full production; they designed several video games and pinball prototypes over the ensuing months before the company ultimately failed in 1984.</p>

<p><b>1982:</b> Harry Williams, who has been involved with pinball for nearly a half century, submits the design for a game called Cue to Stern Electronics. Cue was meant to be a "simpler" game that was much less expensive to make that would help keep pinball on its feet through the rise of arcade video games. Cue performed so poorly in 6 test locations that it never made it to a full production run. Cue was the last of the nearly 200 pinball games contributed to by Harry Williams before his death in 1983, aged 77.</p>

<p><b>September 1982:</b> Gottlieb releases Caveman, a pinball game with a television screen mounted into the playfield that is considered to be the first game ever to feature a video mode.</p>

<p><b>Late 1982:</b> Bally formally consolidates Midway into their pinball division, forming Bally Midway. This was done to protect their assets against the looming video game crash of 1983, while also making it easier to incorporate more high-powered electronics into pinball, including some early video modes. The first game released by the new Bally Midway was Grand Slam in March 1983.</p>

<p><b>1983:</b> The Coca-Cola Company acquires Columbia Pictures and renames the Gottlieb pinball division to Mylstar. After no fewer than half a dozen games that did not survive the prototype or planning phases, the first Mylstar game to reach full production is Rack 'Em Up! in November 1983.</p>

<p><b>January 1983:</b> Bally releases BMX, the first game with flex-save lanes. These are lanes at the bottom of the playfield that are originally out lanes, but can be turned into in lanes if a player presses a second button on each side of the cabinet with good timing. This feature was only used on two other tables: Dungeons & Dragons and Hardbody, both from 1987.</p>

<p><b>September-October 1984:</b> Columbia Pictures closes down Mylstar Games. A new management group called Premier Technology purchased the assets and revived the company as Premier Gottlieb, a name they would use for the next decade-plus. The first game released by Premier Gottlieb was El Dorado: City of Gold in September 1984.</p>

<p><b>December 1984:</b> As their first and only commercially produced pinball game, Wico Corporation releases Af-Tor, the first game from any manufacturer to use alphanumeric displays capable of showing letters and words in addition to scores.</p>

<h3>Late 1980s</h3>

<p><b>May 1985:</b> Premier Gottlieb releases Chicago Cubs Triple Play, the second alphanumeric game from any manufacturer and the first to include the now-iconic ability for highest scoring players to enter their initials alongside their scores.</p>

<p><b>June 1985:</b> Williams releases Comet, their last pre-alphanumeric game, which was heavily (and incorrectly) marketed as being the first pinball game ever that allows players to score 1,000,000 points with a single shot. This is a landmark moment in score inflation, which has also seen pinball score displays grow from 3 digits in the early 1960s, to 5 digits by the early 1970s, to 7 digits in 1980 in an attempt to make new games feel bigger and grander than older ones. The Million Point Shot on Comet requires completing a series of events at a specific time, but with the incoming invention of the jackpot, earning a million points at a time would become easier and easier.</p>

<p><b>1986:</b> With the remains of the assets from Stern Electronics and the funding and naming rights of Data East Japan, Gary Stern re-enters the pinball industry by founding Data East Pinball. The modern Stern Pinball considers this event to be the establishment of the current iteration of their company, but a ship-of-Theseus argument can be made that their roots extend all the way back through the Stern Electronics era and back to the founding of Chicago Coin in 1932.</p>

<p><b>January 1986:</b> Williams, who is now formally known as WMS Industries but still uses the marketing name Williams, releases High Speed. High Speed is Williams' first alphanumeric pinball, as well as the first game by anyone with a multiball-exclusive jackpot, a progressive carryover jackpot, compensation programming for broken switches, auto-percentaging for flexing replay scores, operator reports, and the ability to play a complete song during gameplay. High Speed sold over 17,000 copies, and the sound and light show very much revitalized the pinball industry for the second half of the 1980s.</p>

<p><b>March 1987:</b> Williams releases F-14 Tomcat, the first game with a ball save feature, allowing players to continue their turn if they drain the ball very quickly or if the Yagov Kicker in the left side of the playfield inadvertently fires the ball directly between the flippers.</p>

<p><b>May 1987:</b> Data East releases Laser War, their first game and the first game by any manufacturer to use stereo sound. "Digital Stereo" would become a major marketing point in most of Data East's games up through the invention of the dot-matrix display.</p>

<p><b>July-August 1987:</b> Zaccaria releases Star's Phoenix and New Star's Phoenix, their only multiball games and their final production games at all. Zaccaria's exit from the industry means only INDER from Spain is left as a major European pinball manufacturer. Zaccaria would briefly re-emerge in 1989 as Mr Game releasing a combination video game/pinball called Motor Show, but to very little success.</p>

<p><b>May 1988:</b> Williams releases Banzai Run, a game made famous by having a second, entirely vertical playfield in the back of the game. It was the first game designed by Pat Lawlor, who would become one of the premier and highest-selling pinball designers of the 1990s.</p>

<p><b>Mid 1988:</b> Bally sells their amusement games divisions, including the Bally Midway pinball division, to WMS Industries, forming what is now commonly known as Bally Williams. The Bally and Williams names will be used alternately on pinball games, while the Midway name is used for future arcade and video games such as Mortal Kombat and NBA Jam. The first pinball released after the Bally Williams merger was Truck Stop in November 1988.</p>

<h3>Early 1990s</h3>

<p><b>January-February 1991:</b> The first Professional and Amateur Pinball Association World Championship tournament is held at Lone Star Roadhouse in New York, New York, USA. Joey Cartagena won the inaugural tournament. This tournament has come to be known in retrospect as PAPA 1, with future PAPA world championships increasing the number like a sequel series due to the tournament not being held every year.</p>

<p><b>February 1991:</b> Data East releases Checkpoint, the first game with a dot-matrix display of any kind. It is 128x16 pixels, half the height of the now-conventional DMD, but it can still display player scores, fonts, and basic animations. This was revolutionary, and pinball manufacturers of all sizes would pivot to DMDs across 1991 and 1992. The DMD was intended to debut with Data East's previous game, The Simpsons from September 1990, but it was delayed by one game out of concerns that the technology was not ready yet and that the company might fail if incomplete or faulty technology was attached to a game with such a popular licensed theme as The Simpsons.</p>

<p><b>February 1991:</b> Williams releases The Machine: Bride of PinBot, which breaks new score inflation boundaries by offering the Billionaires Club, a single shot worth 1,000,000,000 points. While for now it is largely a novelty that can be easily disabled and forces players onto a separate high score board, the billion point shot would also become mainstream as score inflation reaches a fever pitch.</p>

<p><b>March 1991:</b> The International Flipper Pinball Association (IFPA) is founded, and holds their first World Pinball Championship tournament, which is separate from the PAPA World Championship. The inaugural open tournament featured 16 players, all men, and all from the USA: Rick Stetta won the championship. IFPA 1, as it would come to be known, also hosted a women's division tournament simultaneously, featuring 6 participants and won by Jeri Lock. PAPA would add a women's division to its own World Championships with PAPA 3 in 1993.</p>

<p><b>May 1991:</b> Bally Williams releases Gilligan's Island, their first game with a dot-matrix display. The first Bally Williams game <i>designed</i> with a DMD was Terminator 2: Judgment Day, but a longer development cycle and desire to release that game alongside the film meant that Gilligan's Island preceded it by two months. Both games uses a display with the now-standard resolution of 128x32 pixels.</p>

<p><b>Late 1991:</b> Alvin G. & Co. is founded by Michael Gottlieb in an attempt to get the Gottlieb family back into the pinball industry after his grandfather David sold the family company off in the late 1970s. Their first game is a two-player head-to-head game called A.G. Soccer-Ball, a pinball where two players stand on opposite ends of the table and flip the ball at each other. Their first conventional pinball, Al's Garage Band Goes On a World Tour, would come out in December 1992.</p>

<p><b>March 1992:</b> Bally Williams releases The Addams Family, designed by Pat Lawlor, which becomes the best-selling flipper pinball game of all time. The original run sold 20,270 units, barely edging past Bally's Eight Ball from 1977; a 1994 celebratory re-release added another 1,000 copies. The Addams Family is known for popularizing mode-based pinball, including a computer-controlled autoflipper, and having what are widely considered to be some of the best callouts in pinball history performed by Anjelica Huston, the late Raul Julia, and the rest of the cast of the 1991 Addams Family film.</p>

<p><b>October 1992:</b> Bally Williams releases Fish Tales, the first game with lightning flippers. These flippers have a lightning bolt design on them and are 1/8 inch shorter than a standard 3-inch flipper, being 2-7/8" long. The request for smaller flippers was made by European operators who felt that ball times on recent pinball games had been getting too long. Lightning flippers were largely disliked by American audiences due to the added likelihood of center drains and the fact that shot locations were not designed with the shorter flippers in mind. By 1994, Bally Williams was back to putting 3-inch flippers in every machine. Lightning flippers live on today, both in preservations of the games they came in and as a popular modification for tables that did not originally have them to make those games harder and shorter for tournament play.</p>

<p><b>1993:</b> INDER releases their final game, Bushido, after over 20 years in the industry, marking the end of the last large European pinball manufacturer. Interestingly, Bushido was INDER's only game to feature a dot matrix display.</p>

<p><b>September 1993:</b> Data East releases Last Action Hero pinball, the first game with design input from Lyman Sheats Jr. Sheats would go on to design or provide software coding for some of the most well-loved games of the 1990s through 2010s, including Attack From Mars (Bally Williams, 1995), Medieval Madness (Bally Williams, 1997), and Metallica (Stern Pinball, 2013).</p>

<p><b>November 1993:</b> Alvin G. & Co. releases their final game, Pistol Poker. They shut down in 1994 having released only 6 unique games, none of which sold more than 1,000 copies.</p>

<p><b>April 1994:</b> The IFPA holds the IFPA 4 World Championship tournament, now featuring Pinmaster, Open, Women's, Manufacturer, Mixed Team, and Juniors divisions. This was the last IFPA World Championship before the organization went on indefinite hiatus.</p>

<p><b>September 1994:</b> Data East releases Maverick: The Movie, their final game. Maverick was the first game to include a mega dot matrix display with resolution of 192x64 instead of the typical 128x32. Data East sold their pinball division to Sega during development of this game, and Sega took over production halfway through.</p>

<h3>Late 1990s</h3>

<p><b>October 1995:</b> Noted video game team Capcom opens Capcom Coin-Op, a pinball division, with the release of their first game, Pinball Magic.</p>

<p><b>1996:</b> Score inflation reaches its peak. Bally Williams games like Johnny Mnemonic, JackBot, and Attack from Mars as well as Sega games like Batman Forever and Goldeneye become infamous for handing out hundreds of millions or even billions of points at any opportunity. By the end of 1996, most pinball companies will cut down their scores by two or three orders of magnitude so players can calculate score more easily and programmers can save processing power or DMD space. Williams specifically went from a default replay score of 3,800,000,000 on JackBot to a default replay of 8,000,000 on Tales of the Arabian Nights barely half a year later.<br>Score inflation does still exist in the 21st century, but to a much lesser extent; rather than simply being based on the year of their release, differences in scoring on pinball games of the last decade or so tend to be due to one of the following four reasons.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Company decision: Stern Pinball games tend to give out points a bit more freely than Jersey Jack, for example</li>
	<li>Thematic considerations: James Bond 60th Anniversary LE (Stern Pinball, 2023), Total Nuclear Annihilation (Spooky, 2017), and Pulp Fiction (Chicago Gaming, 2024) have lower scores than their contemporaries due to their desire to emulate games from the 1960s, mid-1980s, or late-1980s respectively</li>
	<li>Expanded progression: modern rulesets may not limit the value of certain scoring features, allowing skilled players to earn many billions or trillions of points on games like Batman 66 (Stern Pinball, 2016)</li>
	<li>Software bugs: such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0DLbGVEZHY" target="_blank">this example</a> of a single mode being worth 16 quintillion points on Guns 'n Roses: Not In This Lifetime (Jersey Jack, 2019)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>August 1996:</b> Premier Gottlieb closes its doors. Their final game, Barb Wire, was released in April; a Brooks & Dunn table was in development when the company folded, with a completed playfield, mostly complete plastics orders, and only somewhat complete software. </p>

<p><b>December 1996: </b> After 4 production games and 2 limited run prototypes, Capcom shuts down their Coin-Op division after just over a year. The only major pinball manufacturers left are now Bally Williams and Sega. Capcom's final production game, Flipper Football, is the first game ever to have its score display located entirely under the playfield glass.</p>

<p><b>June 1997:</b> Bally Williams, who is still going strong for now, releases Medieval Madness. While not particularly innovative in any specific ways, Medieval Madness will end up being considered as one of the best pinball games ever made due to its shot design and flow, theming, and easy-to-understand rules.</p>

<p><b>Summer 1998:</b> The Steel City Pinball Association in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA holds the first Pinburgh tournament. Pinburgh was a rather popular tournament held every summer until the mid-2000s, and has since undergone several revivals.</p>

<p><b>January 1999:</b> Bally Williams releases Revenge from Mars, a direct sequel to 1995's Attack from Mars and the first game to use their new Pinball2000 platform. Pinball2000 uses reflections to display a computer generated image as a sort of hologram over the back of the playfield. The game sells well, with more copies produced of Revenge from Mars than Attack from Mars.</p>

<p><b>June 1999:</b> Bally Williams releases Star Wars Episode I, their second Pinball2000 game but also their last pinball game. In October, WMS Industries announces their exit from the pinball industry, citing declining profits in pinball and rising profits in the slot machine industry. Two further Pinball2000 games, Playboy and Wizard Blocks, have their work abandoned with little more than whitewood playfields and very incomplete software to show.</p>

<p><b>September 1999:</b> Sega releases Harley-Davidson, their final game (not to be confused with the Bally Williams Harley-Davidson from 1991). Shortly after the game reaches production, Gary Stern buys out Sega's stake in pinball, pulling production over to his own new company, Stern Pinball. Stern will end up having a near-monopoly on the pinball industry for the next 15 years, and they are still present and releasing games as of 2026.</p>

<h3>21st Century</h3>

<p><b>2000s:</b> Stern remains the only major pinball company for the entire decade, focusing on tables with popular contemporary licenses including Austin Powers, The Lord of the Rings, Nascar, Family Guy, and Wheel of Fortune. The Great Recession of 2008 leads to some layoffs and tight financial times, but the company ultimately recovers.</p>

<p><b>December 2000:</b> Visual Pinball is initially released to the public for the first time, allowing users to create their own pinball games (and other similar types of games) for free on their computer. Over the next years and decades, dedicated groups of people will recreate hundreds of machines from all eras for virtual play.</p>

<p><b>July 2004:</b> After being absent since 1998, the PAPA World Championship returns with PAPA 7 held at the PAPA World Headquarters in Scott Township, Pennsylvania, USA. This event merged the PAPA World Championships and Pinburgh tournaments (for a few years, anyway); PAPA World Championships would be held every year until PAPA 20 in April 2017.</p>

<p><b>2006:</b> The IFPA introduces the World Pinball Player Rankings (WPPRs, commonly pronounced like "whoppers") system, meant to provide a standardized ranking system for all pinball players. WPPR points are assigned to each final placement in a league or tournament, with additional points given to longer competitions or competitions with a higher average player skill level. WPPR points earned, and the resulting rankings, determine who is able to qualify for state, provincial, and world pinball championships. The WPPR system is still in use today, with the rules updated as WPPR version 6.1 in 2025.</p>

<p><b>March 2008:</b> Under the leadership of brothers Josh and Zach Sharpe, sons of pinball legend Roger Sharpe, the IFPA World Pinball Championships return with IFPA 5 at the Pinball Hall of Fame in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. With exceptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, an IFPA World Championship has been held every year since 2008; IFPA 20, the 2025 edition, is scheduled for June 27-29, 2025 at the Hall of Pinball Fame in Ragnitz, Austria.</p>

<p><b>June 2010:</b> MarsaPlay, a new but ultimately short-lived manufacturer from Spain, releases New Canasta. It is a remake of INDER's game Canasta 86 (1986), but is notable for being the first pinball game by any company to use a full LCD screen for scorekeeping. </p>

<p><b>August-December 2010:</b> Stern Pinball releases James Cameron's Avatar, their first game to include multiple "editions" with slightly different artwork, layouts, and features. This would evolve into the Pro/Premium/Limited Edition model structure that Stern continues to use as of 2026.</p>

<p><b>March 2011:</b> Pinburgh returns as its own tournament, using a matchplay style instead of a world championship-style bracket. The matchplay format proved extremely popular, and the tournament experienced record-setting growth.</p>

<p><b>April 2013:</b> Jersey Jack releases The Wizard of Oz, their first pinball game and the first game from an American manufacturer to use an LCD screen. Jersey Jack's incorporation ends the near-monopoly held by Stern on the pinball industry for well over a decade while simultaneously helping start a new wave of pinball companies and popularity.</p>

<p><b>March 2014:</b> Spooky Pinball joins the scene with their first game, America's Most Haunted. They will later become known for games such as Total Nuclear Annihilation and Rick and Morty. Somewhat infamously, Spooky releases all of their games in rather limited runs to ensure steady sales and lower expenses in what can be a very volatile industry.</p>

<p><b>March 2015:</b> Chicago Gaming Company, which was founded in 2001 but initially focused on arcade video and redemption games, releases a remake of Medieval Madness. They would go on to revive other 1990s Bally Williams hits, such as Cactus Canyon, Attack from Mars, and Monster Bash over the next six years.</p>

<p><b>December 2015:</b> Visual Pinball X, also known as Visual Pinball 10 and abbreviated as VP10 or VPX, is released. VPX is open source and provides some of the most advanced and comprehensive physics and graphics ever seen in virtual pinball. VPX is still used and updated in 2024, with the most recent version being Visual Pinball 10.8.</p>

<p><b>December 2016:</b> Stern releases Batman (2016), better known as Batman 66 since it uses the 1966 <i>Batman</i> live-action television series as its source material. It's their first game with an LCD screen, confirming that that will be the new norm for pinball.</p>

<p><b>2017:</b> Multimorphic Pinball unveils their P3 platform, which consists of a "shell" table with a handful of flippers and shots in default positions as well as interchangeable "modules" that can be swapped in or out so the same table can play many different games.</p>

<p><b>June 2017:</b> Jersey Jack releases Dialed In!, the first pinball game with Bluetooth connectivity as well as the first game to include a camera for taking pictures of players.</p>

<p><b>October 2019:</b> Stern Pinball releases Elvira's House of Horrors, the first game with a full screen to use new custom-filmed scenes rather than relying entirely on pre-existing stock footage or animation.</p>

<p><b>March 2020:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic begins in North America. The Pinburgh 2020 matchplay tournament, which was slated to be the largest pinball tournament in history with over 1,200 players, is completely cancelled due to health reasons. By November, PAPA's parent organization Replay Foundation will effectively shut down all tournament operations citing lack of funding and health concerns. 

<p><b>2021:</b> Stern Pinball launches Insider Connected. This program allows players to sign in to any LCD Stern machine with their smartphone to earn achievements and track and compare scores.</p>

<p><b>October 2023:</b> Barrels of Fun releases their first game, Jim Henson's Labyrinth.</p>

<p><b>Summer 2024:</b> Chicago Gaming Company releases Pulp Fiction, their first commercial pinball game to be completely original rather than a remake of a previous game.</p>

<p><b>July 2024:</b> After 5 years of hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Pinburgh matchplay tournament is revived. The comeback year was strictly limited to 144 players, significantly less than the attendance of pre-COVID Pinburgh tournaments, but the event was successful and Pinburgh did return in 2025 with a larger registration limit.</p>

<p><b>September 2024:</b> The PAPA World Pinball Championship returns with a new entry in the form of PAPA 21 LFS, a world championship-style tournament at Enterrium in Schaumburg, Illinois, USA, with all proceeds benefitting charitable causes seeking to end suicide. LFS were the initials of Lyman F. Sheats Jr., a longtime pinball devotee who won PAPA 3, 7, and 9 in 1993, 2004, and 2006 respectively; he also spent many years working on game software and full game designs for Data East, Bally Williams, and Stern Pinball. Tragically, Mr. Sheats took his own life in 2022 at the age of 55. Like the revived Pinburgh matchplay, PAPA 21 had limited attendance in its first year back, and is expected to continue to grow with the PAPA 22 tournament scheduled for September 2025.</p>

<p><b>November 2025:</b> the "Outer Banks incident" or "OBX incident" takes place. At the OBX Flippers Main Tournament in Grandy, NC, an onsite non-tournament employee committed hate crimes of verbal harassment and intimidation toward a queer pinball player attempting to peacefully use the restroom. The events led to a large portion of the tournament's attendees walking out over safety concerns while other attendees made death threats against them in private messages. Despite significant community criticism and in defiance of the entire IFPA Women's Board, IFPA president Josh Sharpe and director Adam Becker chose to uphold the certification for the OBX tournament and silence or blame victims and protestors, thereby prioritizing the sanctity of their rankings points over the protection, representation, and well-being of women and LGBTQ+ pinball players. In the aftermath of this event, the entire IFPA Women's Board resigned from their positions, and major movements encouraging players to suppress themselves from earning WPPR points and encouraging tournament directors not to submit results to the IFPA took hold. Despite these events, Sharpe and Becker continue to hold positions of power within the IFPA. Read more about this incident <a href="solidarity.html">here.</a></p>
