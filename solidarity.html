<p>On Friday, November 7, 2025, at the OBX Flippers Main Tournament in Grandy, NC, a hate crime occurred against a queer pinball player, who was chased from the venue by a non-tournament staff member with threats to call the police after attempting to peacefully use the restroom. In response, head tournament director Kevin Stone did nothing to proactively solve the problem, allowed the tournament to continue, and elected not to remove the harasser until she left at the end of her shift several hours later. These events led to nearly 20% of the event's registered participants walking out. Kevin Stone did apologize later for not doing enough in the moment, but many considered it to be too little, too late.</p>

<p>The following statements about the International Flipper Pinball Association (IFPA) and their response to the incident are true:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The IFPA has a very clear policy outlining how tournaments should be safe spaces for everyone regardless of age, gender, sexuality, race, skill, or any other trait. A tournament unable to uphold these protections should not be able to provide its players with world pinball ranking points.
	<li>It took 6 days following the initial incident to publicly acknowledge the events or a surrounding investigation.</li>
	<li>The IFPA decided not to revoke sanctioning for the OBX tournament, despite it becoming an unsafe place to play for a considerable number of tournament attendees, which directly conflicts their own policy.</li>
	<li>Despite the official IFPA response being signed as from "IFPA Staff", it was written by a single cisgender, straight, white male who was not in attendance at the event. The response directly conflicts the unanimous recommendation of the 5-member IFPA Women's Board, the wishes of tournament director Kevin Stone himself, and the nearly 1,000 signers of <a href="https://www.change.org/p/remove-wpprs-from-obx-fall-flippers-failure-to-follow-ifpa-guidelines">this Change.org petition.</a></li>
	<li>The IFPA took concerted steps to silence and/or blame victims of the event, people fighting trauma as a result of the event, and people standing in solidarity with the victims of this hate crime.</li>
	<li>The IFPA shut down civil discussion occurring in their Discord server after the publicly-available Facebook profile of the hate crime committer was shared, citing "doxxing", but then failed to redact full names, phone numbers, and other personal identifying information when compiling 8 pages of internal Slack messages for public release.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Pinball Primer is almost exclusively written by a single trans woman, and I will not be attending or supporting any IFPA-sanctioned events until signifcant action is taken by the IFPA to repair their trust from the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

<p>If you support trans rights, LGBTQ+ equality, and women's representation- in general, but especially in pinball- send a comment to the IFPA via their comment box <a href="https://www.ifpapinball.com/menu/about/send-us-a-comment/">here</a> or send an email to <a href="mailto:ifpareport@gmail.com">ifpareport@gmail.com</a> encouraging IFPA President Josh Sharpe and IFPA Director Adam Becker to: implement significant reform in policies supporting players in vulnerable groups; affirm that steps are being taken to prevent such incidents from happening in the future; and/or resign from their positions of power effective immediately.</p>
