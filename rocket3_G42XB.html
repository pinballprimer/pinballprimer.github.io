<h1>Rocket III (Bally, 1967)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Nudge to keep the ball in the top area with the spinning structure and blue mushroom bumper for as long as possible because once the ball comes down the playfield, it's probably not going back up. Once the ball is in the lower half of the playfield, carefully shoot red mushroom bumpers all day, keeping the flippers zipped together as much as possible. <br><u>Do whatever it takes to avoid playing Rocket III, especially in a tournament or other competitive setting.</u></p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Upper playfield</h3>

<p>At the start of each ball, the three mushroom bumpers on the left are lit, and the three on the right are not. Lit mushroom bumpers score one letter in Rocket and 100 points. Unlit blue mushroom bumpers score 10 points. Hitting a lit left mushroom bumper will unlight it and light the mirror-image blue mushroom bumper on the right. Hitting a lit right mushroom bumper will unlight it, but does not relight the mirror-image blue mushroom on the left.</p>

<p>A constantly rotating structure known as the Spinning Flipper is in the center of the top of the playfield, and is here to score absolutely zero points and throw the ball out of control. It always spins anticlockwise, making it a little harder to get a ricochet into the right blue mushroom bumpers than the left ones.</p>

<h3>Lower playfield</h3>

<p>All mushroom bumpers and pop bumpers score 10 points. Red mushroom bumpers add a Rocket letter and close the flippers. Yellow mushroom bumpers reopen the flippers. Wall switches on the sides score 1 point. Slingshots score 10 points. Out lanes score 50 points.</p>

<h3>Rocket letters</h3>

<p>Rocket letters are collected from any red mushroom bumper or a lit blue mushroom bumper. If at least three letters are lit and the center flippers are not zipped together, the right out lane gate will be open, redirecting the ball to the shooter lane. Using the gate closes it, and the only way to reopen it on the same ball is to completely spell Rocket to reset it, then earn three more letters. If exactly 5 letters are lit and the center flippers are not zipped together, the left out lane will be lit for special, and also an automatic kickback will be active. Completing the spelling of Rocket resets all letters, including closing the right out lane gate and disabling the left out lane kickback, and moves the lit planet on the backglass one position. The backglass planets are a carryover award; advancing to planet 8 or 9 (operator-adjustable) can award 1 or 2 or 3 free games, or 100 or 200 or 300 points, or an extra ball (also all operator-adjustable). </p>

<h3>Final notes</h3>

<p>Rocket III can be set to 3, 5, or 7 balls per player. The ideal outcome is 3, because that means you don't have to play this game as much. A common modification to make this game more fair for tournament play is to disable the carryover planets award by either make it so that the adjustable award is never given out, or so that the adjustable award is given out every time Rocket is spelled and the planets are advanced.</p>
