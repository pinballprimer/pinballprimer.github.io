<h2>Game rules and strategy</h2>

<p>Shoot up the sides of the playfield and try to get the ball to roll through the Target Value side lanes. Avoid collecting the Target Value from the center standup due to the center drain risk on the return, especially given how wide this game's flipper gap is.</p>

<p>Top lanes score the indicated value: 20-30-40-50-40-30-20. The blue POP bumper always scores 1 points. Red pop bumpers and slingshots score 1 point or 10 when lit. Rollover buttons on the playfield turn on the left bumper and slingshot, the right bumper and slingshot, or turn off all bumpers and slingshots. Draining the ball also turns off all bumpers and slingshots.<br>The two middle side lanes, two out lanes, and center standup target score the Target Value. Target Value is represented by the number that is directly above the center standup target. Scoring the Target Value advances it one step. The Target Value is a pseudo-progressive jackpot; it scores 20 points three times, then 30 three times, then 40 three times, then 50 three times, then 100 twice, then Mystery Score, before returning to 20. Mystery Score randomly awards 100, 200, or 300 points based on the status of the game's score motor when the Mystery is scored. The Target Value is never reset on its own, and stays where it is across players, balls, and games.<br>Beware the massive flipper gap. There is no end of ball bonus, extra ball, or playfield special. Tilt ends game. In a 2-player game, tilt only ends game for the offending player.</p>
