<h1 style="color:red;">Pro Pool / Play Pool (Gottlieb, 1973)</h1>

<p>Pro Pool is the single-player, add-a-ball sister table to Hot Shot and Big Shot, covered <a href="hotshot_G5n1Q.html">here.</a> Pro Pool has the same layout as those two games, but the rules are different enough that it gets its own page for the sake of clarity. Play Pool is an identical game to Pro Pool, manufactured for European export.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Plunge the 8 ball to make your life just a little bit easier. Complete 1-8 or 8-15 (notice the 8 is part of both groups) to light Wow at the center targets or side lanes, which scores an extra ball. If a Wow is lit, try to hit it as much as you can, because when the ball drains with a Wow on the table, any completed drop target banks will reset and credit for the 8 ball will be taken away, forcing the player to complete a new set for more extra ball chances.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Outer lanes score 1,000 points. Center lane scores 5,000 points and awards the 8 ball.</p>

<h3>Bumper</h3>

<p>Always scores 1,000 points.</p>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>1-7 balls are on the left, 9-15 are on the right. Each target down scores 500 points. Due to slow EM motor scoring, you will probably only get the 500 points from one target if two or more are hit in very quick succession. The status of the drop target bank is preserved between balls, unless the bank is completed and the 8 ball is collected, in which case that bank will reset after the current ball in play.</p>

<h3>Center standup targets</h3>

<p>Score 1,000 points. Completing 1-8 lights the left target for Wow, and completing 8-15 lights the right target for Wow. Wow scores an extra ball, and these targets can be hit repeatedly to rack up extra balls for the remainder of the current ball in play once they are lit.</p>

<h3>Center saucer</h3>

<p>Awards the 8 ball and scores 5,000 points. The 8 ball can be collected at any time.</p>

<h3>Side lanes</h3>

<p>Score 1,000 points. Completing 1-8 lights the <i>right</i> lane for Wow, and completing 8-15 lights lights the <i>left</i> lane for Wow, opposite of the way the center targets are lit. </p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Pro Pool has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes always score 1,000 points and in lanes always score 500. Unlike the replay versions, there is no gate in the right out lane.</p>

<h3>Bonus?</h3>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus. Progress on a bank of drop targets is carried over from ball to ball, unless a bank was completed and the 8 ball is also lit, in which case that bank will reset and the 8 ball will unlight prior to the next ball in play.</p>
