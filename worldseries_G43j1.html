<h1>Grand Slam / World Series (Gottlieb, 1972)</h1>

<p>Grand Slam is the replay version. World Series is the add-a-ball version.<br>These are electromechanical games, and are not to be confused with Grand Slam (Bally Midway, 1983).</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Lit saucers on the baseball diamond act like runners. Score runs, separately from pinball points, by advancing the runners to home plate through scoring features marked Single, Double, Triple, and Home Run. Thresholds for both pinball points and baseball runs can score replays (or extra balls in World Series, the add-a-ball version). If you're concerned just with pinball points, focus on anything that gives 1,000 points, such as saucers, lit bumpers, and white roto disc panels. Also, scoring a Home Run when all saucers are lit is worth 5,000 points.</p>

<br>

<h2>How the baseball "players" work (for people unfamiliar with baseball)</h2>

<p>"Players" are represented by lit saucers, moving clockwise from "home plate" between the flippers. Single, double, and triple advance the lights counterclockwise once, twice, or three times each. If a "player" returns to home plate after 4 advances, they score a run and are removed from play. If a Home Run is scored, you instantly receive one run per lit saucer, plus an additional run to represent the "batter" who made a home run (effectively a "quadruple", if the pattern is to be followed).</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>There are two sets of two. Either the left lanes in each pair will be lit, or the right lane in each pair will be lit, but never both or neither. The leftmost lane scores 200 points and a double when lit. The rightmost lane scores 300 points and a triple when lit. The two middle lanes score 500 points and a home run when lit. All four lanes score 100 points and a single when not lit. 10-point switch hits alternate which lane in each pair is lit.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Score 100 points, or 1,000 when lit. They alternate being lit or not with each 10-point switch.</p>

<h3>Roto wheel</h3>

<p>The wheel is spun whenever the ball enters one of the three "base" saucers. Singles, doubles, triples, and home runs score 100, 200, 300, and 500 points respectively, and move the "baseball players" (lit saucers) accordingly. The white panel of the wheel scores 1,000 points but doesn't do anything to the baseball players.</p>

<h3>Upper left and right standup targets</h3>

<p>Score 100 points and a single when not lit, or 500 points and a home run when lit. One is lit at a time, alternating with 10 point switches, just like the top lanes.</p>

<h3>Side lanes</h3>

<p>The left side lane scores a double and 200 points. The right side lane scores a triple and 300 points.</p>

<h3>"Base" saucers</h3>

<p>Entering any saucer scores 1,000 points, spins the roto wheel, and instantly puts a runner on that base (lights that saucer) if it was not already lit. There is no score difference between lit and unlit saucers.</p>

<h3>Center pitcher's mound star rollover</h3>

<p>Scores 100 points, or 1,000 when lit. It is only lit when the bases are loaded (all three saucers are lit).</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>World Series has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes score a home run and 500 points. In lanes score a single and 100 points. The gap by which the ball can enter the in/out lane area is very small, so balls rarely end up here anyway. Most drains on this table are center drains, due to this and due to how wide the flipper gap is.</p>

<h3>Bonus?</h3>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus. Baseball runs scored and the position of the "runners" (lit saucers) are preserved from ball to ball since this is a single player game. This is an add-a-ball game, but the only extra balls available from the pinball points and baseball runs scoring thresholds shown on the scorecard.</p>
