<h1>Twin Win (Bally, 1974)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Keep the ball in play in the upper half of the playfield as much as possible. Lit top standup targets award 5 bonus advances. When bonus is high, make the corresponding top saucer to collect and reset the bonus. Player 1 only builds the yellow bonus on the left, and player 2 only builds the green bonus on the right. Bonus is only collected at the end of the ball if you drain down the out lane, not from a center drain. Advancing or collecting the bonus earns Laps, which light extra ball and Special.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Starting a ball</h3>

<p>Twin Win does not have a conventional plunger or shooter lane. Instead, press the button on the front of the cabinet where the shooter rod would be to launch the ball upward between the flippers and into play. This launch is usually strong enough that the ball goes between the pop bumpers in the center of the playfield as well.</p>

<h3>Advancing and collecting Bonus</h3>

<p>Player 1 always builds and collects the Yellow bonus, and player 2 always builds and collects the Green bonus. Top standup targets award 100 points and 1 bonus advance when not lit, or 300 points and 5 bonus advances when lit. 10-point switch hits alternate whether the red or white standup targets are lit. The saucers in the top left and top right are always able to collect the current bonus. Bonus starts at 1,000 points and maxes out at 10,000. Collecting the bonus resets it back to 1,000 and advances your colour's car by one position for each 1,000 points in bonus collected. The saucer that does not correspond to your colour, e.g., green for player 1 and yellow for player 2, will always score 1,000 points and advance the car that is <i>not</i> your colour by one position.</p>

<p>Bonus is only collected at the end of the ball if you drain down an out lane. Only your colour bonus is collected from the out lane. No bonus is awarded for a center drain.</p>

<h3>Laps; moving the Car</h3>

<p>The yellow pop bumper, mushroom bumper, and standup targets advance the yellow car, and the green pop bumper, mushroom bumper, and standup targets advance the green car, regardless of which player is currently playing. All bumpers and yellow/green standup targets score 100 points. If player 1 is up, the yellow standup targets are lit for 3 yellow card advances, and likewise for the green standup targets if player 2 is up. Hitting a top standup target advances your car (yellow for player 1, green for player 2) once if the target is not lit or 5 times if the target is lit. Collecting a bonus advances the car corresponding to that bonus's colour once for each 1,000 points earned from the bonus.</p>

<p>Advancing a car 10 positions completes one Lap. The yellow and green car are represented by the inner and outer lane of lights on the racetrack in the center of the playfield. If the current player's lap count ends in 4, 6, or 8, the red mushroom bumpers at the top of the playfield will be lit alternately for extra ball, switching every time a 10-point switch is scored. If the current player reaches the required number of Laps, the top mushroom bumpers will both be lit for Special; this Special can be earned once per ball on each ball for the rest of the game. The required number of laps is 9 in a 3-ball single player game; 12 in a 3-ball two-player game; 13 in a 5-ball single player game; or 19 in a 5-ball two-player game.</p>

<h3>Spinning disc</h3>

<p>The disc at the top of the playfield constantly spins during gameplay, altering the ball's direction. It doesn't tend to have too much impact on the ball's movement; in the rare cases where it does, the spinning disc is far enough away from the flippers that the new ball trajectory can be reacted to and slam dunks straight down the middle are uncommon.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes. Flippers back up directly to the slingshots. Full size three-inch flippers are used. Slingshots score 10 points. Out lanes collect the current player's bonus (yellow for player 1, green for player 2).</p>

<p>Tilt ends the ball in play only. Do not be afraid to make a big move to save the ball from a center drain, where no bonus is scored.</p>

<p>Special can score a free game or an extra ball. To my knowledge, near Special nor extra ball can ever be set to award points for competition/novelty play, meaning if Twin Win gets used in a tournament setting, there is no reason to focus on completing Laps.</p>
