<h1>Granada (Williams, 1972)</h1>

<p>This game has similar artwork to Spanish Eyes (Williams, 1972). They are commonly considered sister games, with Spanish Eyes being the replay version and Granada being add-a-ball, but the two have quite different playfields and rules.
<br>This article discusses the game produced by Williams. Zaccaria's version of Granada, released in 1974 and featuring drop targets along the sides of the playfield instead of standup targets, has its own guide <a href="granadazacc.html">here.</a></p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Spell Granada from the top lanes and in lanes, or light all of the 1-10 targets in the upper half of the playfield, to light center standup targets for Special. Collect a Special to earn a Star; Stars light side saucers for 5,000 points, and lighting both qualifies the center Super Special. Specials score an extra ball or 50,000 points; Super Special scores 2 extra balls or an adjustable score between 200,000 and 500,000 points.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Spelling Granada</h3>

<p>Top lanes and in lanes each score 5,000 points. Making an unlit lane will light that lane's letter: G-R-A-N-A at the top lanes and D-A at the in lanes. On easy settings, the three As can be tied together, so that collecting any of the three gives credit for all three. Lighting all 7 letters in Granada lights the left target in the center 3-bank. This target scores 1,000 points, or a Special when lit; the Special can score 100,000 points or one extra ball. Scoring the Special resets the lit Granada letters, unlights the Special, lights the Granada Star, and lights the left saucer to score 5,000 points instead of 500.</p>

<h3>1-10 targets</h3>

<p>Surrounding the pop bumpers are standup targets labelled 1-10 that score 100 points each. Hit an unlit target to light it. Odd numbers are on the left and even numbers are on the right. On easy settings, targets 3 & 7 as well as targets 4 & 8 can be tied together, so that hitting either target in a pair gives credit for both of the numbers in the pair. Lighting all of 1-10 lights the right target in the center 3-bank, which scores 1,000 points or Special when lit, just like the left target. Collecting this Special awards the 1 to 10 Star and lights the right saucer for 5,000 points.</p>

<h3>Super Special</h3>

<p>The center standup target scores 5,000 points. When both the Granada Star and the 1 to 10 Star are lit, the center standup target is lit for Super Special. In add-a-ball mode, Super Special is worth 2 extra balls, but in novelty mode (according to IPDB) the Super Special can be set to give anywhere from 200,000 to 500,000 points in 100,000 increments. Collecting the Super Special unlights both stars, and is effectively the wizard award of the game.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous scoring</h3>

<p>Pop bumpers always score 100 points. A gate between the two lower bumpers that the ball can pass through if moving horizontally scores 500 points. Wall switches on the top of the structure that contains the center 3-bank score 10 points. Slingshots score 10 points.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Granada has a conventional in/out lane setup, but with 2-inch mini flippers instead of conventional 3-inch flippers. In lanes score 5,000 points as well as the D (left) or last A (right) in Granada. Out lanes score 1,000 points.</p>

<p>Tilt ends the ball in play only. There is no end of ball bonus.</p>
