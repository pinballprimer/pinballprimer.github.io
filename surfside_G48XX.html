<h1>Surf Side (Gottlieb, 1967)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Surf Champ/Surfer (Gottlieb, 1976) or Surf 'n Safari (Premier Gottlieb, 1991).</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Hit bullseye standup targets and top lanes to advance the multiplier on the red and yellow roto-target value, then collect that value when the multiplier is 100x after 9 advances. It's safer to stay in the upper half of the playfield and use the upper flippers to backhand the roto-target, but it's hard to keep the ball up there.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Roto-target</h3>

<p>The roto-target can show numbers from 1 to 5 inclusive, or a Star. Two faces of the roto-target are exposed at a time: the left exposed face is Red, and the right exposed face is Yellow. There are 2 different multipliers, also called red and yellow. The lowest value for a multiplier is 1x; advancing a multiplier 4 times increases its value to 10x, and advancing a multiplier 5 further times (9 total) increases its value to 100x. The left and right top lanes score 50 points advance the red or yellow multiplier (respectively) by the number shown on the red or yellow roto-target face (also respectively; the Star counts as a 1). Any bullseye standup target advances both multipliers 1 time and scores 100 points. Hitting a roto-target, making an out lane, or hitting a red or yellow standup target in the center of the table, scores the number displayed on that roto-target multiplied by that colour's multiplier. If a roto-target value with a multiplier of 100x is collected, that colour multiplier will be reset back to 1x. Hitting the Star counts as 1 point (which can be multiplied to 10 or 100) and also scores an extra ball.<br>It is safest, but quite difficult, to collect a roto-target value by backhanding the roto-target itself from the upper flippers. Hitting the roto-target directly from the lower flippers is possible, but very precise. Shots to the center playfield standup targets that score the roto value put the ball at high risk of being out of control and ricocheting into out lanes.</p>

<p>The value of the colour multipliers never resets on its own at the beginning of a ball or beginning of a game. Take note of this when stepping up to the table or playing a multiplayer game. In a competitive setting, you may wish to collect a 100x roto-target to prevent your opponent from doing the same, even if the number on the roto-target itself is small.</p>

<h3>Pop bumpers</h3>

<p>All bumpers score 1 point, or 10 points when lit. The red and yellow pop bumpers are lit only when the same colour's multiplier is advanced to at least 10x. The center pop bumper toggles whether it is lit or not every time a 1-point switch is scored.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes. Flippers back up directly to the slingshots. Slingshots score 1 point, or 10 when lit; only 1 slingshot is ever lit at a time, and they alternate which one is lit every time a 1-point switch is scored. Out lanes score the current red (left) or yellow (right) roto-target value.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus or playfield special. Tilt ends the current ball in play only.</p>
