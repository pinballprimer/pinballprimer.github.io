<h1>Trail Drive (Bally, 1970)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Early in the game, plunge the top lanes to light the bumpers. Once bumpers are lit, always plunge the top center hole to open the right out lane gate- especially if you can hit the Increase Value button on the way so the hole scores 3,000 instead of 300. From the right flipper, always shoot the middle-left saucer for 5,000 points. From the left flipper: if free games are important to you, shoot for lit Trail Drive letters, otherwise try to get the ball stuck in lit bumpers or tap pass the ball to the right flipper for a left saucer shot.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>On the plunge</h3>

<p>At the very top of the table are three rollover buttons. The left and right buttons score 10 points, and the center button is labelled Increase Value. Below the buttons are two top lanes and a top saucer in between them. The top lanes score 100 points; the left top lane lights the lower green pop bumper and awards the R in Trail, while the right top lane lights the two red pop bumpers and awards the R in Drive. The game can be set so that these two lanes are tied together; if this is the case, making either lane awards both Rs and lights all three pop bumpers. The top saucer scores 300 points, opens the right out lane gate, and awards the A in Trail. Making the saucer immediately after pressing the Increase Value button above it will cause it to score 3,000 points instead of 300. Pop bumpers score 10 points, or 100 when lit.</p>

<h3>Trail Drive letters</h3>

<p>The main goal of Trail Drive is to spell Trail Drive. Hit a lit rollover switch or mushroom bumper to unlight it and earn its letter. Any switch corresponding to a Trail Drive letter scores 100 points, except for the top center saucer as described above. Spelling Trail Drive lights one out lane for Special, alternating each time a 10-point switch is hit anywhere in the game. As far as I have found, Special always scores a free game and cannot be set to an extra ball or points, making it a dud in competition/novelty play.<br>Trail Drive letters are found at the following locations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>T: the left mushroom in the center of the table</li>
	<li>R: the left top lane</li>
	<li>A: the top center saucer</li>
	<li>I: the left out lane</li>
	<li>L: the upper left mushroom bumper</li>
	<li>D: the right mushroom in the center of the table</li>
	<li>R: the right top lane</li>
	<li>I: the right out lane</li>
	<li>V: the upper right mushroom bumper</li>
	<li>E: the middle-right standup target</li>
</ul>
<p>On easy settings, the two Rs and two Is can be tied together, so that earning either one gives credit for both.</p>

<h3>Left saucer</h3>

<p>The left saucer always scores 5,000 points, making it the most valuable feature in the game. It is generally accessed by shooting through the one-way gate due left of the T mushroom bumper, but a fluky bounce can cause the ball to enter the saucer from the exit above the left slingshot. The left saucer kicks the ball out downwards; it should eject the ball out with enough force that it lands at the right flipper or right slingshot. Always shoot for the left saucer whenever possible.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes. Flippers back up directly to the slingshots. Full size 3-inch flippers are used. Out lanes score 100 points and correspond to the Is in Trail Drive. If Trail Drive has been spelled, the out lanes can be lit for Special alternately based on 10-point switch hits. Making the top center saucer opens a gate in the right out lane that closes once used or once the ball drains. There is no protection from a left out lane or center drain.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus or extra ball feature. Tilt ends the entire game, not just the ball in play. To my knowledge, Special cannot be set to score points in competition/novelty play. Collected Trail Drive letters and lit pop bumpers are preserved from ball to ball.</p>
