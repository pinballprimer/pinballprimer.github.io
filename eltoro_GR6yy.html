<h2>Game rules</h2>

<p>There are two stacked sets of top lanes. The upper set of 3 top lanes includes the E lane worth 100 points, the extra ball lane worth 1,000 points, and the L lane worth 100 points. Immediately below those lanes are a set of 4 more top lanes, which award the letters in TORO from left to right; the T and second O score 100 points, while the first O and the R score 1,000 points and light the two upper pop bumpers for 100 points instead of 10. Roll through a lit lane to collect that letter and unlight the lane. In a 3-ball game, the two Os are tied together, so that collecting either one gives credit for both. Spelling El Toro in full lights the top center lane for extra ball and the middle left side lane for Special; the extra ball and Special alternate being lit on 10-point switches on normal settings, but on easy settings, both stay lit. El Toro letters never reset, so once you've completed the spelling, the Special and/or extra ball are always available. If the game is set to easy settings, you can play forever if you plunge the center top lane every time.</p>

<p>The yellow mushroom bumpers score 100 points (center) or 1,000 points (left or right), and each one lights a number in the right lane. Each of the three switches in the right lane scores 100 points, or 1,000 when lit. The right lane gets completely unlit when the ball exits it. The right lane is generally the safest shot to make with the left flipper, though it's generally too dangerous to shoot the yellow mushroom bumpers to try to increase its value. Ideally, the right lane is a way to transfer the ball from left to right for a shot to the top lanes.</p>

<p>The left side lane always scores 1,000 points in addition to being lit occasionally for Special if El Toro is completed. Special can score a free game or an extra ball, but cannot be set to points. Maximum 1 extra ball per ball in play.</p>

<p>Slingshots score 10 points. Out lanes score 1,000 points. There is no end of ball bonus. Tilt ends game.</p>
