<h1>Seven Up / Set Up (Williams, 1969)</h1>

<p>Seven Up is the replay version. Set Up is the much rarer add-a-ball version. This guide focuses primarily on Seven Up. Differences observed in Set Up are mentioned at the bottom of the page.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Keep the ball in the upper 1/3 of the playfield as long as possible using the mini-flippers on the sides of the game. Completing sets of 1 through 6 in any order scores 300 points and lights the 7 Up target in the top middle for 500 points, plus a Special if you complete 1-6 at least three times. If the ball ends up in the lower half of the table, try to shoot it back up between the two upper bumpers as quickly as possible.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Collecting 1 through 6</h3>

<p>The numbers 1 through 6 can be collected at 6 standup targets in the top corners of the table; 1-2-3 on the left, 4-5-6 on the right. Hitting any of these targets scores 10 points; hitting a lit target unlights it, collecting the corresponding number. Numbers 1 and 6 can also be collected at the middle left and right side lanes respectively; collecting these numbers lights the lower left and lower right pop bumpers respectively. Numbers 3 and 4 can be collected at the side walls that form the "funnel" at the top of the table; collecting these numbers lights the upper left and upper right pop bumpers respectively. Pop bumpers score 1 point when not lit, or 10 points when lit. Numbers 2 and 5 cannot be collected anywhere on the table other than the top standup targets, and collecting the 2 or 5 does not light any other feature on the table.</p>

<p>Completing a 1-6 set instantly scores 300 points and raises the 7 Up target. The 7 Up target is a drop target located behind the playfield rubber within the triangle structure at the top middle of the game. Hitting this drop target scores 500 points. Hitting the 7 Up target three or four times (depending on easy or hard settings) lights any future 7 Up target hits to score a Special in addition to the 500 points. There is no bonus for completing 1-6 again while the 7 Up target is raised, so always hit the 7 Up target as soon as possible to score the 500 points and earn the progress toward Special. The 7 Up Special always scores 1 free game and cannot be set to points or an extra ball.</p>

<h3>A through E: advancing the Skier</h3>

<p>Five switches around the game are labelled A through E. A is located at the middle left side lane; B is a mini-rollover button just left of the 7 Up target; C is a normal rollover button located at the top of the game above the 7 Up target; D is a mini-rollover button just right of the 7 Up target; and E is the middle right side lane. At any given time, one letter is lit. Making the switch corresponding to the lit letter moves the light to the next letter in A-B-C-D-E sequence. Making the E when lit moves the light back to the A and advances the lit-up skier on the backglass one position. After the backglass skier is advanced 10 times, they cross the "finish line" and the middle right side lane is lit for Special; this Special scores 2 free games instead of 1. A through E progress and the backglass skier's progress are held from game to game as a carryover award.</p>

<h3>Posts galore</h3>

<p>Seven Up has a center post and posts in both out lanes that help keep the ball in play when raised. The left and right out lane posts are raised by the corresponding rollover buttons just above the upper left and upper right bumpers. The center post is raised by either of the two rollover buttons just below the lower left and right pop bumpers. Directly above the flipper gap are two further rollover buttons; the lower button of these two lowers both out lane posts, and the upper button of these two lowers the center post. When raised, the center post completely blocks off the flipper gap. However, the left and right posts do not completely block off the left and right out lanes; they mainly serve as an additional surface to nudge the ball off of, and otherwise, the ball can sneak around a raised left or right post and fall out the out lane anyway.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the table, full size 3 inch flippers are used. There are no in lanes. Slingshots score 1 point and out lanes score 100 points. There is no end of ball bonus. Tilt ends game.</p>

<h3>Differences observed in Set Up, the add-a-ball version</h3>

<ul>
	<li>All scoring is multiplied by 10 relative to Seven Up. There are 5 score reels instead of 4 (including the new dummy 0). A 100,000 light above the score reels is added to count scores higher than 99,990.</li>
	<li>Specials can be set to award an extra ball or 10,000 points. If Specials award extra ball, they can either be played as conventional extra balls, or they can be automatically shot back upwards between the flippers as an Extended Play feature. There is no way to earn a free game.</li>
	<li>Hitting the 7 Up target always scores 1 extra ball in addition to the 5,000 points.</li>
	<li>Some copies of Set Up remove the upper flippers entirely, replacing them with posts and rubbers. This makes it significantly more difficulty to complete a set of 1 through 6, and makes the game nearly unplayable if the bumpers are not strong.</li>
	<li>Tilt ends the ball in play only.</li>
</ul>
