<h1>Granada (Zaccaria, 1974)</h1>

<p>This article discusses the game produced by Zaccaria. Williams' version of Granada, released in 1972 and featuring standup targets and saucers along the sides of the playfield instead of drop targets, has its own guide <a href="granadawilliams.html">here.</a></p>

<p>This article describes the rules of Granada as observed in the Zaccaria Pinball video game developed by Magic Pixel. If you have played a physical copy of Zaccaria's Granada and notice the rules to be different from those listed here, please message solar_espeon on Discord or email pinballprimer@gmail.com.

<h2>Game rules</h2>

<p>Out of the 5 top lanes, the middle three each score 500 points and one Advance. The outer two lanes score nothing. Making 10 advances over the course of the game lights the 500-point target in the center of the playfield for Special, which is worth 1 extra ball. According to the in-game rules for Granada in Magic Pixel's Zaccaria Pinball app, clearing a bank of drop targets should award 3 advances toward the center Special, but this does not seem to be the case during gameplay.</p>

<p>Drop targets score 100 points. Complete a 10-bank to light the corresponding 1,000-point target in the center of the playfield for a Special; Specials earned at 1,000-point targets score 10,000 points, which is the highest-value feature in the game.<br>Lit Specials turn off if the ball drains.</p>

<p>Bumpers and the slingshots along the top of the center structure score 10 points. In lanes score 1,000 points. Out lanes score 500 points. Max one extra ball per ball in play. Tilt ends the ball in play only. There is no end of ball bonus.</p>
