<h1>Fun Land / Fun Park / Fun Fair / Tivoli (Gottlieb, 1968)</h1>

<p>Fun Land is the replay version. The other three releases of this game are add-a-ball versions, whose rules are mentioned at the end of the guide.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Shoot spinners all day, hoping that when they stop, the lit award is 500 points. This is really the only thing to do in a points-focused game. Specials cannot be set to award points or extra balls; if the free games are important to you, collect the 1-10 numbers around the playfield from lanes and targets or as spotted numbers from the spinner, then recollect the lone number that lights back up and moves with every 1-point switch hit.</p>

<p>The below picture is of Fun Land, which was taken from the VPX recreation by Loserman76.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>1-10 numbers</h3>

<p>Collect 1-2-3-4 from the top lanes, 5-6 from the upper side lanes, 7-8 from the lower standup targets, and 9-10 from the out lanes. Any numbered lane or target scores 50 points whether lit or not. Numbers can also be spotted by the spinners as described below. After all of 1-10 have been collected, one number will be lit at a time, moving with every 1-point switch hit. Recollecting the lit number at this stage scores an instant special, which can only be worth nothing or a free game. Number sequence only resets at the start of the game.</p>

<h3>Spinner awards</h3>

<p>Individual spins of the spinner do not score points; however, each spin changes the lit value below the spinner between 5, 50, or 500 points. When both spinners stop moving, the currently lit value is awarded. The best strategy for scoring is to simply shoot these spinners whenever possible, giving yourself the most chances to land on the 500 point award.</p>

<p>If the inserts behind the spinners are lit red, each spin of the spinner will move the indicator arrow around the wheel in the playfield. Whenever the spinner stops, the number currently pointed at by the indicator arrow is spotted for you. You can both earn progress in the initial 1-10 set or collect specials using this method. If specials are not lit, the red insert behind the spinner is always on. If special is lit, the red insert behind the spinner will only be on when the red bumper is also lit; each hit to a yellow bumper toggles whether or not the red bumper is lit.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>All bumpers score 1 point, or 10 points when lit. The upper yellow bumpers are unlit at the start of each ball; the rollover button between the yellow bumpers scores no points directly, but lights the yellow bumpers for the rest of the ball. The red bumper toggles whether it is lit or not every time either yellow bumper is hit.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes. Flippers back up directly to the slingshots. Two inch mini flippers are used. Slingshots score 1 point, or 10 points when lit; they are lit whenever the red pop bumper is also lit. Out lanes always score 50 points and award the numbers 9 (left) and 10 (right) as part of the 1-10 sequence.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus or extra ball feature. I believe that tilt ends game.</p>

<h3>Differences seen on Fun Park, Fun Fair, and Tivoli (the add-a-ball versions)</h3>

<p>Numbers 9 and 10 are collected from the rollover button near the bumpers, not the out lanes. All numbers are assigned a colour: green for 1-2-3-4, yellow for 5-6-7-8, and red for 9-10. Whenever 9 and 10 are lit, the top bumpers light for 10 points (or 100 points on Tivoli only); they are worth 1 point when not lit.</p>

<p>Each spin of the spinner scores 10 points. There is a "selected colour" which can be either red, yellow, or green, and changes every time the lower pop bumper is hit. While the spinner is spinning, the game temporarily only lights the number on the wheel that have been collected <i>and</i> are part of the highlighted colour. Each spin of the spinner moves the indicator arrow one position. When the spinner stops, if the indicator arrow is pointing at a collected number when that number's colour is currently selected, you get a bonus award- 500 points for lining up a green, 1 extra ball for lining up a yellow, or 2 extra balls for lining up a red. Collecting any extra balls from this feature causes all of the 1-10 numbers to reset.<br>The optimal strategy here is to collect 1-2-3-4 from the top lanes, but avoid collecting any other numbers where possible. Doing so avoids the scoring of extra balls, but maximizes the probability of a 500 point spinner award while lowering the probability of your 1-10 progress resetting, which is optimal because it's quite rare for a single ball of this game to score more than 500 points without the help of a 500-point green line-up award from the spinners.</p>

<p>On Fun Park, any extra balls earned are fed to the shooter lane and plunged, like any other ball. You can keep collecting extra balls until you have 10 balls to play remaining.<br>On Fun Fair and Tivoli, you can have up to 5 extra balls stored at a time. When you drain the ball with an extra ball lit (as indicated on the left side of the backglass in lights), the pinball will be launched upward between the flippers for continued play at the cost of 1 stored extra ball, rather than being fed back to the plunger.</p>

<p>Tilt penalty on any add-a-ball version of this game is loss of the ball in play plus 1 additional ball.</p>
