<h1>See Saw (Bally, 1970)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Scoring on See Saw is a three step process: build the bonuses (from various switches around the playfield), multiply the bonuses (center standup targets), collect the bonuses (side saucers), repeat. The yellow and blue bonuses do not get collected at the end of the ball, so you must go through this process during your proper ball. The only time to break the build/multiply/collect cycle is if the ball is on the left flipper and the Top Gate in the upper right is lit for 3,000 points and a replunge chance.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes and bumpers</h3>

<p>There are 4 top lanes. The 1st and 3rd lanes from left score 100 points and advance the yellow and blue bonuses respectively. The 2nd and 4th lanes from left score 1,000 points and open the Top Gate. Above the 2nd and 4th lanes are rollover buttons reading On Red Bumpers and On Green Bumpers. Of the four pop bumpers, the top left and bottom right are red, and the other two are green. When a pop bumper is lit, it stays lit for the rest of the ball. Bumpers score 10 points, or 100 points when lit.</p>

<p>Near the upper right pop bumper is a standup target that scores 100 points. After every 10th 10-point switch hit anywhere in the game, this target will be lit for Extra Ball, and unlights when a further 10-point switch is scored.</p>

<h3>Advancing and collecting Bonuses</h3>

<p>See Saw has two bonuses: yellow and blue. Advancing either bonus increases that bonus by 100 points, up to a maximum of 1,000.
<br>Yellow bonus can be advanced by the left target in the upper left 3-bank, the rollover button near the lower left pop bumper, the yellow mushroom bumper on the left, or the left slingshot when lit (alternates being lit with every 10-point switch).<br>Blue bonus can be advanced by the right target in the upper left 3-bank, the rollover button near the upper left pop bumper, the blue mushroom bumper on the right, or the right slingshot when lit.
<br>Advancing either bonus also scores 100 points directly.
<br>The two standup targets in the center of the table qualify 10x Bonus for the yellow (left) and blue (right) bonuses. To collect a bonus, shoot the left (yellow) or right (blue) saucer. A single bonus collect can be worth up to 1,000 points, or 10,000 if the 10x Bonus has been qualified. Collecting a bonus resets that side's bonus back to 100 points and un-qualifies the 10x Bonus light.</p>

<p>Despite having the name "bonus", the yellow and blue bonuses are not collected for free at the end of the ball. The only way to score these bonuses is to shoot a side saucer while the ball is in play. When you drain, both bonuses are reset to 100 points with no 10x lit for the next player/ball.</p>

<h3>Gates, post, kickback, and bottom of the table</h3>

<p>The Top Gate in the upper right is opened by making the 2nd or 4th top lanes from left. Making this gate closes the gate, scores 3,000 points, and puts the ball back into the shooter lane for a replunge. Since most advance bonus switches are in the upper third of the table, using this gate whenever it is open to get back to the top of the table for more bonus advances is a good idea.</p>

<p>The middle standup target in the upper left 3-bank scores 1,000 points and opens the Bottom Gate, which is located in the right out lane. There are no points for using this gate other than the right out lane's normal 1,000 value. This gate closes when used or when the ball drains or the game is tilted.</p>

<p>The center post, which completely blocks off the center flipper gap when raised, is raised via the Up Post button in front of the center standup targets, and lowered by the Down Post buttons near the slingshots (or whenever the ball is drained or game is tilted).</p>

<p>The left out lane scores 1,000 points. There is an automatic kicker in the left out lane that will fire whenever the ball goes down the left out lane when lit; the left out lane is lit intermittently based on 10-point switch hits (seemingly 30% or 40% of the time; <i>not</i> alternating). The kickback does not unlight when used.</p>

<p>Slingshots score 10 points when not lit. One of the two slingshots is always lit, alternating every time a 10-point switch hit is scored. When lit, slingshots score 100 points and advance the yellow (left) or blue (right) bonuses. There are no in lanes; full size 3 inch flippers back up directly to the slingshots.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus. Tilt ends the ball in play only. Maximum 1 extra ball per ball in play; extra ball cannot be set to points. There is no playfield Special.</p>
