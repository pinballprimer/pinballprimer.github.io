<h1>Poker Plus (Recel, 1977/1978)</h1>

<p>Poker Plus has both solid-state and electromechanical versions. This guide was written based on the electromechanical version, but all rules are the same in the solid state version as far as I have found.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Ace drop targets each score 5,000 points and a bonus advance; bonus advances are worth 10,000 each. The center drop target resets all drop targets and scores 10,000 plus 10,000 per knocked-down Ace; if all 4 Aces are down, this target is lit for Double Bonus and the upper left standup target is lit for extra ball. Middle side lanes score 1,000 plus 1,000 per knocked-down Ace; multiply this value by 10 by making the rollover lanes in the upper third of the table.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>There are 3 lanes at the top of the table. At the beginning of the ball, these lanes must be made with a precise-power plunge, since there is no one-way gate ensuring that a top lane is made. The triangular setup of the top of the game makes the center top lane much harder than the other two. The center top lane always scores 500 points and lights both middle side lanes for 10x value. The left and right top lanes scores 500 points and light the left or right side lanes respectively; however, if the left or right top lane is the very first scoring switch registered on a ball, it scores 50,000 points instead.</p>

<p>The pop bumper always scores 1,000 points. The two rollover lanes just below the pop bumper function identically to the left and right top lanes, but with no 50,000 feature.</p>

<h3>Drop targets, side lanes, and more</h3>

<p>Across the center of the table are two Ace drop targets, a lone center drop target, and two more Ace drop targets. Knocking down an Ace scores 5,000 points and one bonus advance (or 2 bonus advances on easy settings). The center drop target scores 10,000 points plus an additional 10,000 for each currently-knocked-down Ace, then resets all of the drop targets. The middle left and right side lanes score 1,000 points plus 1,000 for each currently-knocked-down Ace; this value is multiplied by 10 if the side lane has been lit via the rollover lanes in the upper third of the table. The maximum value for a lit side lane or the center drop target is 50,000 points.</p>

<p>When all 4 Aces are knocked down at once, the center drop target is lit red for Double Bonus, and the 5,000 point standup target in the upper left is lit for extra ball. Earning double bonus from the center target unlights the extra ball, but lights the left out lane for a Special.<br>Try to get to Double Bonus as soon as possible; from there, the best course of action varies from machine to machine and player to player. If the Ace targets are relatively safe to shoot or if it's particularly difficult to get the ball to end up in a lit side lane on purpose, focus on maxing out the bonus first. Otherwise, consider knocking down the 4 Aces but leaving the center drop target alone, milking 50,000-point lit side lanes without resetting the drop target bank.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Poker Plus has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes score 500 points. Out lanes score 10,000 points, and the left out lane scores a Special if Double Bonus has been earned. Slingshots score 100 points. There is no center post, kickback, or other kind of save feature.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced only by knocking down Ace targets. Each Ace can score 1 or 2 bonus advances depending on game settings. Each bonus advance is worth 10,000 points in end of ball bonus. Double bonus is earned by knocking down all 4 Aces, then shooting the lone center drop target last. Max bonus is 2x 150,000 = 300,000 points. The bonus cannot be collected mid-ball or carried from ball to ball in any way. Double bonus is never given for free on any ball.</p>

<p>Tilt ends the ball in play only. If Special or extra ball can be set to score points, I am not sure what values they would give.</p>
