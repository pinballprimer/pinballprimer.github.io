<h1>4 Square / Astro (1971)</h1>

<p>4 Square is the replay version. Astro is the add-a-ball version, with different theming and artwork. This guide focuses on 4 Square. Rules differences observed in Astro are discussed in a separate section at the end of the guide.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Compete sets of 1-2-3-4 to score 500 points and increase the value of various targets in the game. <br>In competition play, try not to complete 1-2-3-4 for the fourth time so that the green targets keep their 200 point value, since special is worth no points.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>1-2-3-4 targets and rollovers</h3>

<p>Each number in 1-2-3-4 can be collected in five places around the playfield: a top lane, a yellow target above and near the bumpers, a green target in the center of the playfield, one of the middle or upper side lanes, and one of the in/out lanes. Before playing, take note of where each one is. All 1-2-3-4 targets and rollovers score 50 points, unless...</p>

<p>Completing 1-2-3-4 once changes the top lane value from 50 points to 200. A second completion does the same for the yellow targets at the top of the playfield, and a third completion does the same for the green targets around the center of the playfield. The fourth completion, however, undoes the scoring boost for the green targets and lights them for special instead- this is bad in competition play, since targets lit for special score no points directly and the specials themselves also have no point value. If playing in a tournament or an arcade where specials are disabled, try to complete 1-2-3-4 exactly three times.<br>If playing casually and specials do matter, note that they will alternate being lit or not alongside the bumpers, but can be collected repeatedly.</p>

<p>Progress cannot be made on a future line until the current line is completed. For example, if 1 and 2 have been collected, hitting another 1 doesn't light the 1 on the next line until the 3 and 4 have been collected on the current lane. Playfield lights will turn off to indicate this.</p>

<p>Any completion of 1-2-3-4 also scores 500 points. This can only be scored 4 times, as the game no longer keeps track of 1-2-3-4 completions after the fourth.</p>

<p>Progress on 1-2-3-4 lines- both completed lines, and the line currently in progress- is always kept from ball to ball. There is no end of ball bonus, and there is no way to earn an extra ball of any kind.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Green ones are worth 1 point or 10 when lit, yellow one is worth 10 points or 100 when lit. Any 1 point or 10 point switch will alternate whether the green or yellow bumpers are lit- it will never be both at the same time. (Those alternating switches also determine whether or not specials are lit at the green targets after completing 1-2-3-4 four times.) It's nice if the ball ends up whacking the 100 point bumper a couple times, but don't shoot for it directly.</p>

<p>If 1-2-3-4 has been completed once, meaning the top lanes are worth 200 points, try to plunge the 1 or 4 lane, even if you already have those numbers on the current line. It's possible to get decent up and down action off the green bumpers and into the 1 and 4 lanes, which can be massively valuable once the lanes are worth 200 points.</p>

<h2>Differences seen in Astro, the add-a-ball version</h2>

<p>Most scores are multiplied by 10 on Astro compared to 4 Square.</p>

<p>The 4 top lanes and 4 bottom lanes are tied together, and spell Star. The four top standup targets, the two lower middle standup targets, and the middle side lanes award the letters in Trek, with each letter being available in two places. The upper left single standup target and upper left side lane can both award a green star, and the upper right single standup target and upper right side lane can both award a red star. Spelling Star Trek and earning both stars scores an instant extra ball, and lights the green star and red star standup targets for additional extra balls. When the ball drains with Star Trek ** completed, the letter sequence resets, but with the S and R in Star and the T and K in Trek being spotted for you to make it easier to complete Star Trek ** again and have another chance at extra balls. Astro counts down the number of balls in play, and a game can start with 3, 5, or 8 balls; each extra ball increases the number of "balls to play" up to a maximum of 10.</p>
