<h2>Game rules</h2>

<p>Earn as many 1-2-3 numbers in each colour as you can. 1s can be earned from the top rollover buttons on the plunge or by hitting the center rotating target when a coloured 1 is showing. Collected 1s each light one of the three top pop bumpers for 10 points instead of 1. 2s and 3s can only be earned from the side standup targets or the white rollover buttons in the lower half of the table.</p>

<p>Making the red 3 lights the left out lane for 300 points instead of 100, and making the blue 3 does the same for the right out lane. Completing the white 1-2-3 lights the bottom pop bumper and the center rollover button for 100 points instead of 10. Completing at least one 1-2-3 set increases the Star Target value from 100 points to 300 and opens the upper right gate for a replunge, which can be used multiple times. Completing all three 1-2-3 sets lights the Star Target for a Special.<br>The center rotating target moves every time it is hit. Hitting a face with a coloured number 1 scores 100 points and spots that 1. The Star Target, which appears as every fourth hit, scores 100 points if not 1-2-3s have been completed, 300 points if at least one 1-2-3 is completed, and a Special if all 1-2-3s are completed. All collected coloured numbers are reset after every ball.</p>
