<h1>Knockout (Bally, 1975)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Shoot the orbits via the spinners all day. The Knockout squiggly top center lane is always a good place to end up; if the star rollovers in the orbits are not yet lit, rolling through the outer top lanes to light them is a good second choice. The best points on Knockout are a bonus of up to 2x 15,000 points, the 1,000-point lit star rollovers in the orbits, and the 3,000-point center saucer.</p>

<h2>Full rules</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>There are two pairs of conventional top lanes, and the squiggly Knockout lane between them. The outer top lane in each conventional pair scores 500 points and lights the star rollovers in that side's orbit. The inner top lane in each pair scores 500 points and is lit alternately for Special (left) or extra ball (right), alternating on any 10-point switch hit, once the base bonus is maxed out at 15,000 points.<br>The squiggly Knockout lane in the center scores 500 points, as well as up to 4 other features: the Knockout lane can award 1 bonus advance, Double Bonus, or light the star rollovers in either orbit. Any or all of the additional awards can be lit, and they change every time a 10-point switch is scored anywhere in the game. The Knockout lane feeds the center saucer.</p>

<h3>Spinners and orbits</h3>

<p>Spinners always score 10 points per spin, which means they rapidly cycle which awards are lit at the Knockout lane as well as whether the extra ball or the Special is lit. Rollover buttons in each orbit score 100 points or 1,000 when lit, and can be lit via the outer top lanes, the Knockout lane, or the lower left and right standup targets. The three star rollovers at the top of the table always award 1,000 points and a bonus advance. Pop bumpers score 10 points or 100 when lit and are lit alongside the star rollovers on the same side of the table.</p>

<h3>Center saucer</h3>

<p>Always awards 3 bonus advances; scores 30 points the first time it is made on a ball, 300 points the second time, and 3,000 points thereafter. Never shoot the center saucer directly; instead, allow the ball to fall into the saucer when it exits the squiggly Knockout lane. The kickout from the center saucer should fall elegantly to the left flipper, but if it does not, consider what nudge or control maneuvers may be necessary to make the return feed safe.</p>

<h3>Lower standup targets</h3>

<p>Score 500 points and light the bumpers and orbit star rollovers on the same side of the table.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Knockout has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes score 500 points and 1 bonus advance. Out lanes always score 1,000 points. Slingshots score 10 points.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by lit star rollovers, the squiggly Knockout lane when lit, and any in lane. Bonus is doubled at the Knockout lane; the Knockout lane seems to be lit for double bonus about 30% of the time, and toggles based on 10-point switch hits. Max base bonus is 2x 15,000 = 30,000 points. Double bonus can be earned on any ball but never carries over from ball to ball. There is no mid-ball bonus collect. When the base bonus is maxed out at 15,000 points, the top lanes adjacent to the squiggly Knockout lane light alternately for extra ball and Special.</p>

<p>Special can award an extra ball or a free game. Maximum one extra ball per ball in play. Special and extra ball cannot be set to score points in a competition/novelty setting. Tilt ends the ball in play only, but bonus is so important that you should never consider tilting Knockout except to avoide a very rare house ball.</p>
