<h1>The Red Max (Bally, 1971)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>If the center post is not raised, hit the mushroom bumper to the right of the captive ball to raise it. Once you're safe from a center drain: with the right flipper, shoot the captive ball, and with the left flipper, shoot for lit right mushroom bumpers if there are any, otherwise shoot for the top right saucer. A full left captive ball hit lights two right mushrooms; collect letters at light right mushrooms, with the top right saucer being worth 1,000 points for completing The, 3,000 for completing Red, and 5,000 for completing Max.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>On the plunge: pop bumpers and top lane</h3>

<p>Pop bumpers score 10 points, or 100 when lit. The top and bottom pop bumpers are green, while the left and right bumpers are yellow: the rollover buttons at the top of the game light the indicated colour of pop bumpers for the rest of the ball. The single top lane on the far left scores 100 points and lights all three right mushroom bumpers; if The Red Max has been spelled entirely, this lane is lit for a special.</p>

<h3>Collecting letters and bonus count</h3>

<p>Hitting a lit mushroom bumper on the right side of the game scores 100 points, unlights that bumper, and spots a letter in the phrase The Red Max. The top lane lights all 3 bumpers at once; the center mushroom bumper lights right mushroom #1; rollover switches in the captive ball lane light right mushrooms 2 and 3.</p>

<p>If no words have been spelled, the bonus value is 500 points. If The has been spelled, the bonus is 1,000 points. If Red has been spelled, the bonus is 3,000 points. If Max has been spelled, the bonus is 5,000 points. The bonus value is not guaranteed to be an end of ball bonus: it is only scored at the out lanes or by shooting the ball into the upper right saucer. The upper right saucer is an immensely finicky shot, as the ball likes to rim around the saucer no matter its speed and direction, but finding a way to get the ball to stick there with some consistency is extremely beneficial.</p>

<h3>Captive ball</h3>

<p>The two rollover switches in the captive ball lane score 1,000 points, and the target at the end scores 1,000 points as well. The first rollover switch lights right mushroom #2, and the second rollover switch lights right mushroom #3. A full shot to the captive ball always scores 5,000 points and lights two bumpers, and if the center post is raised, the captive ball is the only thing that should ever be shot for from the right flipper.</p>

<h3>Left mushroom bumpers</h3>

<p>The two left mushroom bumpers score 100 points and raise (near left mushroom) or lower (far left mushroom) the center post between the flippers.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes. Flippers back up directly to the slingshots. Full size three inch flippers are used. Slingshots score 10 points. Outlanes score the current bonus value based on how many words in the phrase The Red Max are completed. There is no true end of ball bonus or extra ball feature. Bumpers unlight after each ball, but all other scoring features (lit The Red Max letters and right mushroom bumpers) carry over from ball to ball.</p>
