<h1>The Walking Dead - Pro (Stern Pinball, 2014)</h1>

<p>This page discusses the Pro model of The Walking Dead. For the Premium/LE model, click here.<br><i>How to tell:</i> the Premium/LE edition has a large action button labelled Fire on the lockdown bar at the front of the game. The Pro model lacks this entirely.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Complete the left drop targets to light modes; which mode you start depends on which flashing major shot you make after qualifying modes. Complete modes to light Multi-Kill, which is a moving shot that scores 5% of all mode scoring earned this ball plus 2 Walkers. Shots lit with a white crosshair award Walkers, which advance the end of ball bonus and progress toward extra balls. The simplest path to multiball involves repeatedly bashing the Prison in the back of the game or the Well Walker toy in the middle-right; these two multiballs cannot be stacked with each other.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot and top lanes</h3>

<p>A full plunge on The Walking Dead goes up the shooter lane, curves left to go through the pop bumpers, up over two star rollovers, then back to the right toward the two top lanes. On a plunge, the two star rollovers will occasionally be lit as a time-based feature, and one of the two top lanes will be lit as well, with the top lanes light being able to be moved with flipper lane change. The skill shot has two parts: roll over the star rollovers when they are lit, then have the ball roll through the lit top lane. For the first skill shot, you get 250,000 points for making the lit top lane, plus an additional 150,000 for each lit star rollover the ball triggered on the way up. Subsequent skill shots each score 500,000 more points for the lit top lane, and 50,000 more points per star rollover. You get no points and no skill shot credit if the ball does not go down the lit top lane, regardless of how many lit star rollovers were made on the way up. The higher the skill shot value, the faster the star rollovers flash. A maximum value skill shot scores 550,000 points the first time, increasing by 600,000 points each subsequent time, with no limit that I have been able to find.</p>

<p>At any time during gameplay, roll through an unlit top lane to light it. Lighting both top lanes resets them, increases the bonus multiplier, scores the top lanes award, and lights or advances the Bit value.<br>The bonus multiplier is always increased one at a time: if there is a maximum, it is at least 61x. (The limit may be 250x, as it is in some other games programmed by Lyman Sheats.)<br>The top lanes award starts each ball at 50,000 points and increases by 5,000 any time the Tower standup target immediately above the top lanes is hit for any reason.<br>If neither out lane is lit for Bit when the top lanes are completed, one of the out lanes will be lit for Bit with a value of 500,000 points. The chosen out lane appears to be random and not moveable, and the top lanes will never light both out lanes for Bit. Completing the top lanes when Bit is already lit will increase the current Bit value by 250,000 points, plus an additional 25,000 points for each time Bit has been collected in the game so far. Collecting the Bit value will unlight that out lane, and the next time Bit is relit by the top lanes, it will be at the base value of 500,000 points.</p>

<h3>Walkers and shot multipliers</h3>

<p>Any shot lit with a white crosshairs will score a Walker. Shooting a Walker unlights it, but there can never be fewer than 3 Walker shots lit during standard single ball play, so shooting a Walker may relight another Walker as well. Each collected Walker is worth 50,000 points toward the end of ball bonus. At various numbers of collected Walkers, extra ball will be lit at the free ball lane in the lower right- by default, extra ball lights at 10 and 60 Walkers. Maxing out the counter on the playfield at 115 Walkers starts Last Man Standing wizard mode, described much later.</p>

<p>Every 2 Walkers earned lights one of the in lanes for X. Only one in lane can be lit for X at a time, and the lit lane can be moved with flipper lane change. When the ball rolls through the lit X in lane, the next shot made to anything in the game (within 5 seconds) will be multiplied. The exact value of the multiplier depends on how long you wait to use it. When the in lane X is first lit, using it immediately will apply a 2x multiplier to the scoring for the next shot you make. However, if you don't use the X right away and collect 2 more Walkers instead- which would "requalify" the in lane X- then it will be a 3x shot multiplier when it is used. If you collect 2 further Walkers without using the in lane X for a total of 6, the in lane X will be a 4x shot multiplier when used. There seems to be no limit to how high the multilpier from in lane X can go, and a well-timed use of it can be worth tens of millions of points. That being said, though, it can be easy to waste the in lane X unintentionally, especially during multiball, so be on your guard as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Playfield multiplier</h3>

<p>Hitting the two post targets on either side of the Prison lights the Tower standup target above the top lanes, which is accessible with a full shot to the Riot center loop. Hitting the Tower standup target when it is lit qualifies 2x playfield scoring for 30 seconds. Repeating the process before an existing 2x playfield expires will add 30 seconds to the clock on the multiplier; it does not increase the 2x playfield to a higher multiplier. Whenever 2x playfield is active, the red 2x light in front of the Riot shot will be lit or flashing.</p>

<h3>Multi-Kills</h3>

<p>There are over a dozen ways to light a Multi-Kill throughout the game, and they are awarded for doing well in pretty much any multiball or mode. Exactly how the Multi-Kill is started will be mentioned alongside the applicable modes. When Multi-Kill has been qualified, one major shot in the game will be lit with a yellow circle. Making the lit yellow shot scores 2 Walkers plus 5% of the score you earned in all the modes where you qualified a Multi-Kill across the entire game so far.<br>Lighting a Multi-Kill by any means lights one of the 6 weapon inserts across the middle of the playfield. Lighting all 6 qualifies Horde mini-wizard mode at the free ball lane in the lower left.</p>

<h3>"Dead Features" main modes</h3>

<p>Complete the 3-bank of lower left drop targets to make progress toward qualifying a mode. The first mode requires just 1 completion of the left drops, but all others require 2. When modes are qualified, the large rectangle inserts in front of the 5 mode shots will be solidly lit for modes that have been completed, or flashing for modes that have yet to be played. Shoot a flashing shot to start that mode. All modes are timed, but most can be completed in ways other than letting time expire. Completing the lower left drop targets during a mode adds 10 more seconds to the timer. There are 5 main modes to play, and after they have all been played, the 6th "main mode" is a mini-wizard mode called Escape Terminus.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Barn:</b> left orbit mode. Shoot the left orbit as many times as you can in 40 seconds. Left orbit shots score 2,500,000 the first time, increasing by 500,000 each subsequent time, up to a maximum of at least 7,000,000. This mode cannot be completed other than by draining the ball or letting time run out. Making 3 left orbit shots during Barn awards a Multi-Kill.</li>
	<li><b>CDC:</b> left ramp mode. When the mode starts, the only available shot is the left ramp, worth 750,000 points. Making the left ramp lights one of the other mode shots in the game with a red arrow. Subsequent shots to the left ramp each score 25,000 more points than the previous one and light an additional red arrow. Once a red arrow shot has been made, the red arrow shot value is locked in: at this point, you can continue to shoot red arrow shots to score their values, or you can also shoot the left ramp 2 more times. The first of the two scores the red arrow shot value, and the second of the two scores the sum value of all lit shots made during the mode + ends the mode. To earn a Multi-Kill, shoot any 3 lit shots throughout the mode, regardless of whether they are left ramp shots or lit red arrow shots.</li>
	<li><b>Riot:</b> center loop mode. The Riot value starts at 1,500,000 points and increases by 25,000 per switch hit anywhere in the game. Shooting the center loop scores the Riot value and increases the per-switch addition by 2,500 points. Shoot the center loop as many times as you can in 40 seconds: 2 shots are required to receive the Multi-Kill.</li>
	<li><b>Tunnel:</b> right orbit mode. The mode value starts at 5,000,000 points. Shoot the right orbit to score the mode value and increase it by 2,500,000 points per shot, or shoot any other mode shot to lock in the mode value. Once the mode value is locked in, you can either shoot the Tunnel right orbit to end the mode, or you can continue shooting other lit shots, and you can add 2,500,000 to the per-shot value by completing a set of all of the non-Tunnel shots. To earn the Multi-Kill, shoot any non-Tunnel shot, then shoot any mode shot.</li>
	<li><b>Arena:</b> right ramp mode. This one is complicated. The first shot to the ramp scores 3,000,000 points and adds 1,200,000 to the value of the next shot. The second shot to the ramp accordingly scores 4,200,000, and adds 1,300,000 to the value of the next shot. This process continues, with each ramp shot adding 100,000 more to the ramp value than the previous shot did. However, if more than about 5 seconds pass without the right ramp being scored, the <i>current</i> ramp value will be cut in half. The amount by which the value is raised does not change, though. Try to combo the right ramp repeatedly for the biggest points. 3 right ramp shots during this mode awards the Multi-Kill. Immediately after making a right ramp shot during Arena mode, if you shoot the Woodbury free ball lane just below the right ramp, the mode will end with a cashout value equal to 50% of the sum of the right ramp value awards you earned during that mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>After all 5 modes have been played, qualifying another mode at the drop targets causes all 5 mode shots to flash, and shooting any of them will start Escape Terminus mini-wizard mode. In this mode, you want to shoot the 5 mode shots once each in any order. Each shot value is a hurry-up whose starting value depends on how well you did in the 5 main modes. The first hurry-up's value is equal to the total mode score from whichever main mode you completed 5th. The second hurry-up's starting value is the sum of the total scores from the mode you completed 5th, plus the mdoe you completed 4th. This continues in sequence, with the 5th and final mode shot being a hurry-up whose starting value is the sum of all 5 modes you played. Escape Terminus ends when all 5 shots are made or when a hurry-up times out. When Escape Terminus ends by any means, all 5 main modes must be played again before you get another shot at Escape Terminus.</p>

<h3>Supplies</h3>

<p>When all 3 drop targets on the left are still standing, the flashing Supply in front of the bank will rotate between First Aid, Weapons, and Food. Knocking down any drop target locks in the selected Supply until the drop target bank is completed. Completing the bank awards the selected Supply, even if it does not light a main mode. You can recollect the same Supply multiple times without needing to earn a copy of all 3 supplies once first. Each Supply comes with its own benefits.</p>
<ul>
	<li>First Aid: increases the value of all Walkers in Clear the Prison Yard (Prison Multiball, qualify phase 2) by 100,000 points each.</li>
	<li>Weapons: lights the Arena right ramp for a Crossbow attempt.</li>
	<li>Food: increases a multiplier on the next shot to the Well Walker toy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every 10 completions of the left drop targets awards a Multi-Kill.</p>

<h3>Crossbow shots and mode</h3>

<p>Collecting the Weapons supply from the drop targets lights one charge of the Crossbow at the right ramp. When the Crossbow is charged, make a reflex shot to anywhere in the game to score big points. I'm not sure exactly how the points are determined, but it seems to be anywhere from 1,500,000 to 2,500,000 in increments of 125,000. After 3 successful Crossbow shots, Multi-Kill is awarded and the Crossbow mode begins. Crossbow mode lasts until 30 seconds pass without the right ramp being made. Any shot to the right ramp during Crossbow mode qualifies a Crossbow shot that can be redeemed at any other major shot. Redeemed Crossbows recollect the values of the 3 standard Crossbows that you used to start the mode. The first Crossbow during the mode recollects Crossbow #1; the second scores Crossbow #1+#2; the third scores #1+#2+#3; the fourth scores 1+2+3+1; etc.</p>

<h3>Multiballs</h3>

<p>The Walking Dead has 3 flavors of multiball: Prison, Well Walker, and Blood Bath. Blood Bath can be stacked with either of the other two multiballs, but Prison and Well Walker cannot run at the same time. Multiball can always be started while a main mode is running. A main mode can only be started while a multiball is running if competition settings are turned OFF.</p>

<p><b>Prison Multiball</b>
<br><i>Qualify, phase 1: Spell Prison.</i> Shoot the Prison doors in the back of the game. Each shot awards a letter in Prison. As many as 5 letter in Prison may be spotted for you at the start of the game, but after Prison Multiball has been played once, you need to get all 6 letters yourself. After spelling Prison, all letters will flash; shoot the Prison one more time to advance to the next phase.
<br><i>Qualify, phase 2: Clear the Prison Yard.</i> The Prison doors will open, and all 5 major shots will be lit red. Shoot a lit red shot to kill a Prison Yard Walker. The zombie head behind the now-open Prison door will spot a shot for you. Kill 6 zombies to clear the prison yard and start multiball. The first of the 6 zombies killed in this phase scores 500,000 points; each subsequent one scores 50,000 more than the last. If you kill 3 zombies in very quick succession via any method during this mode, you get a 1,000,000-point Killing Spree secret award. After killing all 6 Prison Yard zombies, shoot the Prison one more time to start multiball.
<br><i>Multiball, phase 1: alternating jackpots.</i> Prison Multiball is a 3-ball multiball with a generous ball save, but no add-a-balls. You start by needing to spell Prison again. Each letter in Prison requires a pair of shots. The first shot in each pair can be scored at any lit red shot or at the Prison door; this scores a double jackpot, unlights all shots, and opens the Prison door. The second shot in each pair can only be scored at the zombie behind the now-open Prison door; this score a single jackpot, relights all shots, and awards a letter in Prison. Base jackpot value in this phase is 350,000 points, plus an additional 35,000 per lit letter in Prison. Hitting the two post targets on either side of the Prison will increase a multiplier applied to the next jackpot of any kind that is collected at the Prison. After completing the 6 pairs of shots to spell Prison, Super Jackpot is lit, and can be collected by making a full shot to the Riot loop just left of the Prison that loops around and hits the Tower standup target just above the top lanes. This super jackpot is almost certainly the most valuable shot in all of Prison Multiball, making it an ideal time to use your in lane X shot multiplier if you have one. Collecting the Super Jackpot starts multiball phase 2.
<br><i>Multiball, phase 2: ramp out.</i> The ramp value in this phase starts at 500,000 points. Making either ramp scores the current value and adds 50,000 to the next ramp's value. Shoot the Prison at any time to recollect all ramp values earned since the last time the Prison was hit. This phase continues until single ball play resumes.
<br>Multi-Kill is awarded for making 4 jackpots of any kind during Prison Multiball.</p>

<p><b>Well Walker Multiball</b>
<br><i>Qualify, phase 1: Spell Well.</i> Shoot the Well Walker toy 4 times to spell Well, then one more time to advance.
<br><i>Qualify, phase 2: Well Walker mode.</i> To complete this phase, you need to shoot the Well Walker 5 times for the first Well Walker Multiball, plus 2 additional times for each instance of Well Walker Multiball that has already been played. During this mode, the 4 letters in front of Well will flash on and off in pattern. Each shot to the Well Walker during this phase scores 50,000 points, plus an additional 5,000 for each lit letter; the fourth letter counts double, for a maximum value of 75,000 points. 2,500 points are added to all scoring in this phase for each time Well Walker Multiball has been previously played during the game. The final hit to the Well Walker starts multiball and scores the sum of all previous Well Walker shots during this mode.
<br><i>Multiball, phase 1: switch hits.</i> Well Walker multiball is a 2-ball multiball with no add-a-balls. Light jackpots by hitting switches anywhere in the game. The 4 jackpots required to advance need 20, 25, 30, and 35 switch hits respectively. The jackpot value starts at 25,000 points; hitting the Well Walker toy itself adds exactly 390,000 points to the jackpot, while any other switch in the game adds 25,000 to the jackpot. Once the requisite number of switch hits is made, collect the jackpot at the Well Walker toy (though you can continue to build the jackpot by shooting anything other than the Well Walker toy). After 4 jackpots have been earned, the Well Walker is immediately lit for Super Jackpot, which recollects the 4 jackpots earned so far and is the best time to use a large shot multiplier from in lane X or playfield multiplier from the Tower.
<br><i>Multiball, phase 2: ramp out.</i> This phase's rules are identical to Prison Multiball phase 2, but the recollect of the ramp values is earned at the Well Walker toy instead of the Prison.
<br>Multi-Kill is awarded for making 3 jackpots during Well Walker Multiball.</p>

<p><b>Blood Bath Multiball</b>
<br><i>Qualify: </i>Collect all three types of Supplies (see above) to cause the Blood Bath insert to flash, then complete the drop target bank one more time.
<br><i>Multiball: </i>Blood Bath is a 2-ball frenzy multiball. Every switch in the game scores 15,000 points and adds 15,000 points to the Blood Bath Jackpot. Completing the drop targets scores and resets the Blood Bath Jackpot and adds 2,500 points to the per-switch value of the frenzy. Completions of the drop targets in this phase still award Supplies; if you collect all three types of Supplies during multiball, you earn a Super Jackpot, equal to the sum of all jackpots made since the start of multiball (or since the last Super Jackpot). The first two regular jackpots and all super jackpots collected during Blood Bath Multiball add one additional ball to the playfield, unless all 4 balls are already in play. Blood Bath Multiball is the only multiball that can be stacked with any other.
<br>Collecting any 3 jackpots during Blood Bath Multiball awards a Multi-Kill.</p>

<h3>Fish Heads and Woodbury</h3>

<p>Every 3 shots to the right ramp, no matter what else it may be lit for, scores a Fish Head. The first Fish Head in a game scores 100,000 points, and all subsequent Fish Heads score 10,000 more than the previous. Collecting any Fish Head lights the Woodbury free ball lane for a pseudo-mystery award. Collecting 3 Fish Heads counts as one "completion" and awards a Multi-Kill.</p>

<p>Woodbury is the free-ball lane in the far lower right of the playfield, where extra ball can be lit. Making this lane when lit offers a Woodbury award. In a Woodbury award, multiple awards are shown on the dot display, with one of them highlighted. The flippers can be used to scroll through the list of awards, including other awards that are not part of the initially shown list of 4 (I believe there are always 7 total). To select an award, leave it highlighted, then manually plunge the ball into the lit top lane. Successfully scoring the "skill shot" in this way awards whatever you chose. Woodbury awards usually include various amounts of points, bonus multipliers, lighting an in lane X multiplier, starting a Multi-Kill, or lighting or advancing the Bit value. Using Woodbury to Light Bit when one out lane is already lit for Bit is the only way to have Bit lit on both out lanes at the same time.</p>

<h3>Bicycle Girl</h3>

<p>At 5, 25, 45... Walkers killed, the left ramp is lit for Bicycle Girl. Bicycle Girl consists of 4 hurry-ups, each more valuable than the last and all collectible at the left ramp. The starting values for the 4 hurry-ups are 1,250,000, then 1,500,000, then 1,750,000, then 2,000,000. All hurry-ups count down to 250,000 and stay there for a brief moment before timing out; if a hurry-up times out, the mode ends. Bicycle Girl also ends if the ball drains or if all 4 hurry-ups get collected. Making just the first 3 Bicycle Girl hurry-ups awards a Multi-Kill.</p>

<h3>Pop Bumper jackpots</h3>

<p>Each pop bumper scores 10,470 points (+500 per pop bumper completion). When the ball is in the pop bumpers, the display will show a warehouse with "Don't Open, Dead Inside" on the doors, and a number in the lower left corner. The number counts down how many pop hits are needed to complete the current level of bumpers, and I believe it starts the game at 50. Completing the bumpers scores 75,000 points (+1,500 per completion), lights the Tunnel right orbit for the pop bumper jackpot worth 1,500,000 points (+125,000 per completion), and increases the pop bumper value to 25,000 points (+1,250 per completion) until said pop bumper jackpot is collected. When the jackpot is collected, the next level of bumpers begins immediately, which requires 5 more bumper hits to complete than the previous level did.</p>

<h3>Wizard modes</h3>

<p><b>Horde</b>
<br><i>Qualify by:</i> collecting 6 different Multi-Kills, as indicated by the large rectangle inserts with weapons on them in the middle of the playfield.
<br><i>Start by:</i> shooting the Woodbury free ball lane.
<br>Horde starts as a 2-ball multiball. All 5 main mode shots will be lit for Walkers, which "advance at different rates". The longer you wait, the more lights are lit on one of the 5 main mode shots. Shooting a lit shot kills that Walker, giving an award equal to your current Multi-Kill value times the number of inserts that were lit at that shot. Each shot has 4 lights- red arrow, the mode light, then yellow Multi-Kill light, then Walker light- so each shot can give up to 4x your Multi-Kill value. If you wait too long and let a shot advance past 4x, though, the zombie at that shot will "bite you" and the entirety of Horde will end. Horde works on a wave system: the first wave requires killing 3 zombies at any shot, and each subsequent wave requires 1 more than the previous one did. The final zombie of a wave awards a super jackpot equal to the sum of the values you earned from all other zombies in that wave, and also adds a ball to the playfield (unless all 4 are already in play).<br>If you get down to 1 ball remaining and have completed at least 3 waves, the Woodbury free ball lane will be lit. Shooting this lane gives you the option to Fight or Escape. If you choose Fight, the mode continues. If you choose Escape, Horde ends and you receive the cashout jackpot. The cashout starts at 1,000,000 points; every switch in the game increases the cashout by 100,000 points, plus an additional 25,000 per completed wave so far. By the time you have the option to Escape, it will very likely be well into the eight figures of score, and is an option that should be considered.<br>Horde ends if the Escape was taken, if all balls drain, or if a zombie bites you because it was left unshot on the playfield for too long. If you get bit, the flippers are locked and all balls are allowed to leave the playfield: normally, you get to keep shooting after this happens, but supposedly, in competition settings, failing Horde in this way counts as a drain and ends your turn. I have not been able to verify this.</p>

<p><b>Siege</b>
<br><i>Qualify by:</i> collecting a Super Jackpot in 2 different Prison Multiballs.
<br><i>Start by:</i> shooting the Prison once after Prison Multiball ends.
<br>Siege is a single ball mode, and is the only mode in the game that continues on your next ball if you drain while it is running. Siege comes in two parts. In part 1, shoot the left CDC ramp and right Arena ramp for 2,500,000 points each, then shoot the Prison for 5,000,000 points and advance to phase 2. In phase 2, the 5 major mode shots will be lit again; shoot each one once, plus shooting the Prison once, for an increasing award that starts at 2,500,000 and increases by 250,000 with each subsequent shot. After making all 6 shots, shoot the Prison one more time to end the mode.<br>Siege is hard enough to get to that it can reasonably be considered a mini wizard mode, but the work you put in to get to it and the value it rewards you with are simply not meaningful.</p>

<p><b>Last Man Standing</b>
<br><i>Qualify by:</i> killing 115 Walkers over the course of the game, to max out the display near the flippers.
<br><i>Start by:</i> shooting the Woodbury free ball lane during single ball play.
<br>Last Man Standing starts as a 4-ball multiball. All shots are lit for a Walker, except for the shot that was most recently used to kill a Walker. At any time, one of the 5 main mode shots will have all of its inserts lit instead of just the crosshairs; making this shot does not score any more points than the others, but does give credit for 5 Walker kills instead of just 1. Multi-Kill remains lit during Last Man Standing and does still award the Multi-Kill score, but it does not give you credit for 2 Walkers instead of 1 like it does in normal play. <br>The first shot that kills a Walker in Last Man Standing scores 1,000,000 points; each subsequent shot that kills a Walker scores 400,000 more points than the previous one. Last Man Standing continues running if you get down to just one ball in play, but does completely end if you drain the final ball. Every 10 Walkers killed adds a ball to the playfield (unless all 4 are in play already) and relights the ball saver for about 5 seconds. If you successfully kill 115 Walkers before the ball ends, the flippers lock and all balls are allowed to drain; the game shows you a cutscene, awards 100,000,000 points, and allows you to keep shooting with your Walker count reset so that you can do it all again. 2x playfield can still be qualified and activated during Last Man Standing, and the playfield multiplier does apply to the completion bonus if 2x is running when you kill the last Walker. Completions of Last Man Standing are usually worth a minimum of 1,000,000,000 points, but Last Man Standing is a long endurance mode and it takes a lot of work to both get to it and beat it. Last Man Standing is the true wizard mode of The Walking Dead pinball.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>The Walking Dead has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes can be lit for in lane X, a shot multiplier applied to the next made shot only that is increased by killing Walkers. Out lanes can be lit for Bit, a "big score" out lane drain award that can be lit or increased by completing the top lanes or as a Woodbury award.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is calculated simply as 50,000 points for each Walker killed during the game, times the bonus multiplier. Bonus multiplier is increased 1 at a time with each completion of the top lanes, and there does not seem to be a way to hold bonus multiplier over from ball to ball. If you make it all the way to Last Man Standing, it appears that the game resets your Walker count; however, each trip to Last Man Standing consolidates your 115 Walkers into a Burning Pile, worth 5,750,000 points to the base bonus. Maximum bonus multiplier is likely 250x, as that is the staple in games programmed by Lyman Sheats, though I have not confirmed this.</p>

<h3>Competition settings</h3>

<p>If The Walking Dead is set to Competition Mode by the operator, a few changes take place:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Main modes will not be able to be lit while a multiball is running.</li>
	<li>Extra Ball awards points, though I'm not sure how many- 5,000,000 or 10,000,000 would make sense.</li>
	<li>A loss in Horde that comes from getting bit will end your ball. The only way to end Horde in competition mode without losing your turn is to take the Escape cashout.</li>
	<li>Possibly other things...</li>
</ul>

Be sure to either play this Horde for as long as you can and/or cash it out when the Escape value is in the high 8- or low 9-figures. If you're clever and skilled enough to be able to build up a large in lane X multiplier and keep it in your pocket during multiball, unloading it on any multiball's Super Jackpot probably works here too.</td>

Being in any multiball as frequently as you can will help with this. Half a billion points can be a bit of a grind: take a deep breath, build your end of ball bonus, stay focused, and maybe you'll get to Last Man Standing or light something like Horde along the way.</td>
