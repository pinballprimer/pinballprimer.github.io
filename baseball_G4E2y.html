<h1>Baseball / Batter Up (Gottlieb, 1970)</h1>

<p>Baseball is the replay version. Batter Up is the add-a-ball version. The only differences between the two are that all pinball scoring on Batter Up is multiplied by 10 compared to Baseball, and on Batter Up, benchmark scores award extra balls instead of free games.<br>These games contain both conventional pinball points and a counter for baseball runs. This guide focuses mostly on how to earn pinball points.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>The pop bumpers are lit for 100 points instead of 10 whenever there are runners on both 2nd and 3rd base thanks to vary-target shots, top lanes, or numbered standup targets. If the bumpers are lit, shoot the top corners of the table to take advantage. If not, shoot vary-targets to try to attain similar points.</p>

<h2>Baseball terminology</h2>

<p>"Runners" consisting of lit star rollovers advance around the bases, from 1st to 2nd to 3rd base, when various playfield features are triggered. Advancing a runner past 3rd base brings them home and removes them from the field, which scores one baseball run. Baseball runs are not inherently worth pinball points, but replays (on Baseball) or extra balls (on Batter Up) can be awarded for collecting enough runs, and the feature that prompted the runner to advance usually scores pinball points in its own right.</p>

<p>A "single" advances all runners 1 position, then puts a runner on 1st base. A "double" advances all runners 2 positions, then puts a runner on 2nd base. A "triple" advances all runners 3 positions, then puts a runner on 3rd base. A "home run" scores 1 baseball run for each runner that was on 1st, 2nd, or 3rd base, plus one additional run; the three bases are always empty after a home run. Hitting a standup target labelled 1, 2, or 3 will instantly put a runner on 1st, 2nd, or 3rd base respectively, but does not advance any other runners that may have been on base.</p>

<h2>Gameplay features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Score 50 points and, when lit, put a runner on 3rd/1st/2nd base (from left to right); a lane is lit if there is not already a runner on the corresponding base.</p>

<h3>Playfield values, from the top of the playfield to the bottom</h3>

<p>Green pop bumpers score 10 points, or 100 when lit. Pop bumpers are only lit if there are currently runners on both 2nd and 3rd base; they are off at any other time. 100 points per bumper is already very good value in this game, and one trip up to the bumpers rarely results in just one bump; shoot up here when the bumpers are lit.</p>

<p>Vary-targets can be pushed in to any of 6 levels. The first two levels score 100 points and a single; the next two score 200 points and a double; the 5th scores 300 points and a triple; a full shot scores 500 points and a home run. Vary-targets are the main thing to shoot for when pop bumpers are not lit.</p>

<p>To the outside of the vary-targets are middle side lanes. The one on the left scores 200 points and a double, while the one on the right scores 300 points and a triple. The bumpers kick the ball into these lanes from above somewhat frequently. Trying to shoot them directly from below with the flippers is both very difficult and not advised. Take note of the return feed out of these lanes as well; depending on ball speed and table angle, a ball coming out of these lanes may exit into the in lanes, the top of the slingshots, the flippers, or even the center drain.</p>

<p>Baseball has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes score a single and 100 points. Out lanes score a home run and 500 points. Slingshots score 10 points. Two inch mini-flippers are used.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus, and there are no playfield extra balls or specials. Replay scores are available at various levels of both pinball points and baseball runs; these "replay scores" each award one extra ball on Batter Up instead of one free game as on Baseball, so Batter Up tends to have more benchmark scores and at lower values.<br>On Baseball, tilt ends game. On Batter Up, a tilt disqualifies the current ball and subtracts one ball from the Balls to Play counter.<br>All pinball scoring on Batter Up is 10x as much as on Baseball. Strategy is not affected.</p>
