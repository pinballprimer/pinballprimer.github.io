<h1>Star God (Zaccaria, 1980)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Hit drop targets to advance bonus; complete the left 4-bank to advance the bonus multiplier. Complete the upper right 8-bank to earn letters in God; spell God to light the target behind the 8-bank for Red Special. The target behind the 8-bank always scores a constantly-changing value up to 20,000 points. One center spinner is always lit; the lit one scores 1,000 points per spin and can be good to whale on. Spelling Star at the left orbit and top lanes lights the right target for Green Special, but it's so hard to get all of the top lanes that this is unviable.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes and Star</h3>

<p>A full plunge should go up across the table and loop around the top lanes. However, this frequently does not happen in practice.<br>Top lanes score 1,000 points and a bonus advance. Roll through a lit lane to unlight it. Lane change is not available, so you need to roll through all 3 lanes separately. The three top lanes and the left orbit rollover button together spell Star. Unlight all 4 letters in Star to light the right standup target for Green Special. The right target always scores 5,000 points; the Green Special can score a free game, an extra ball, 50,000 points, or "superbonus", which lights the word Superbonus on the backglass and does nothing else (used in some places to signify an earned free drink, or similar). Collecting the Green Special relights the Star letters. Star letters are reset for each ball.</p>

<h3>Top drop targets and secret target</h3>

<p>Each target down in the top bank scores 2,000 points and a bonus advance. Completing the entire 8-bank awards either 1, 2, or 3 letters in the word God, depending on operator settings. Spelling God in full lights the secret target for a Red Special. The secret target is a red standup target behind the two center drop targets. The secret target can be hit at any time; its value constantly rotates between 5,000, 10,000, 15,000, or 20,000 points, with the speed of the rotation increasing as more drop targets are knocked down. Hitting the secret target when it is lit for Red Special resets the 8-bank, no matter how many targets were down. The Red Special has the same options for its value as the Green Special: free game, extra ball, 50,000 points, or "superbonus".</p>

<h3>Center spinners</h3>

<p>Of the two center spinners, one is always lit for 1,000 points per spin, and one is always lit for 100 per spin; these alternate anytime any of the game's 4 slingshots are triggered (including the two in the upper half of the playfield).</p>

<h3>Lower drop target 4-bank</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 3,000 points and a bonus advance. Completing the 4-bank resets it and advances the bonus multiplier towards its maximum of 5x.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Star God has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes always score 10,000 points. In lanes score 500 points and a bonus advance; one of the two is always lit with a yellow star, which signifies that that lane scores 2 bonus advances instead of 1. The lit in lane alternates any time a slingshot is registered.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Top lanes, the left orbit rollover button, and any drop target advance bonus. Completions of the 4-bank of drop targets advance bonus multiplier. Max bonus is 5x 29,000 = 145,000 points. No part of the bonus can be carried between balls and there is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>
