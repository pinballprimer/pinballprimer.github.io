<p>On Friday, November 7, 2025, at the OBX Flippers Main Tournament in Grandy, NC, a hate crime occurred against a queer pinball player, who was chased from the venue by a non-tournament staff member with threats to call the police after attempting to peacefully use the restroom. In response, head tournament director Kevin Stone did nothing to proactively solve the problem, allowed the tournament to continue, and elected not to remove the harasser until she left at the end of her shift several hours later. These events led to nearly 20% of the event's registered participants walking out.</p>

<p>The International Flipper Pinball Association (IFPA) has released crystal clear guidelines protecting players at any IFPA event regardless of age, gender, sexuality, race, skill, or any other trait. Kevin Stone has publicly apologized for the day's events, but when this incident at OBX was brought to the IFPA's attention, they chose to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>wait 6 days to acknowledge the incident or a surrounding investigation</li>
	<li>release a corporate word salad "response" that was written by a single male administrator (Adam Becker), does not strip the tournament of its certification or provide concrete details about what will be done to prevent similar situations going forward, and also directly opposes the unanimous opinion supplied by the IFPA's Women's Board</li>
	<li>decline to satisfy demand for public comment surrounding the decision while taking steps to silence victims and attendees of the tournament</li>
</ul>

<p>In solidarity with the victims of this hate crime and anyone else who no longer feels comfortable attending an open IFPA event, <b>The Pinball Primer is currently unavailable.</b><br>The Pinball Primer is almost exclusively written by a single trans woman, and I will not be attending or supporting any IFPA-sanctioned events until further, more appropriate action is taken.</p>

<p>If you support trans rights, LGBTQ+ equality, and women's representation- in general, but especially in pinball- send a comment to the IFPA via their comment box <a href="https://www.ifpapinball.com/menu/about/send-us-a-comment/">here</a> or send an email to <a href="mailto:ifpareport@gmail.com">ifpareport@gmail.com</a> letting IFPA President Josh Sharpe and IFPA Director Adam Becker know that their decision is not strong enough to reaffirm safety and equality for EVERY player, and/or that they should resign from their positions of power effective immediately.</p>

<p>If you oppose this cause, please do not continue to use The Pinball Primer in the future.</p>
