<h1>Pit Stop (Williams, 1968)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Shoot the left orbit repeatedly to get back to the top of the table, aiming for the center top lane that scores 200 points and 5 advances (half a lap on the racetrack). The outer top lanes score 100 points and each light a pop bumper for 10 points, so they're not bad either. The left orbit is also lit for extra ball 20% of the time based on your exact position on the racetrack. No other scoring feature in the game is as high value and low risk as just using the left orbit to get back to the top.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes and bumpers</h3>

<p>The left and right top lanes each score 100 points and light the left or right bumper for the rest of the ball. Lit bumpers score 10 points, unlit bumpers score 1. The center top lane does not light any bumpers, but scores 200 points and 5 advances around the racetrack. The center bumper is always lit for 10 points, and each hit of the center bumper only scores 1 racetrack advance.</p>

<h3>Upper standup targets</h3>

<p>The two outer targets score no points, but advance the racetrack 1 step. The two inner standup targets score 100 points and light the nearby pop bumper, just the same as if you had gone through the left or right top lane.</p>

<h3>Left orbit</h3>

<p>The left orbit scores 100 points and returns the ball to the top of the table. If the current player's racer is in the 1st or 6th position after the finish lane, the left orbit will also be lit for extra ball. Maximum 1 extra ball per ball in play.</p>

<h3>Other features: Laps and alternating targets</h3>

<p>The lower left and right standup targets score no points, but advance the racetrack 5 positions.</p>

<p>The center standup target always scores 200 points; it also scores 5 advances if lit. The center rollover buttons score no points, but 1 racetrack advance when lit. Out lanes score 100 points, plus one full lap when lit. All of these features are lit alternately based on 1-point switch hits.</p>

<p>10 total advances around the racetrack constitutes one lap. There is no score for simply completing laps, but extra balls or specials can be awarded for making enough laps. In a 2-player game, each person's racetrack position and number of completed laps are tracked separately.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes. Flippers back up directly to the slingshots. Two inch mini flippers are used. Slingshots score 1 point. Out lanes always score 100 points, and also score 1 full free lap when lit; they are lit alternately based on 1 point switch hits.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus. Tilt ends the ball in play only.</p>
