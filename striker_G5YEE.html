<h1>Striker (Gottlieb, 1982)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Strike (Zaccaria, 1978), World Cup (Williams, 1978), Striker Xtreme (Stern Pinball, 2000), or any of the many soccer- or strike- themed pinball games.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>If you're only concerned with pinball points, just get the ball to the top of the playfield via the spinners as much as possible. Lit spinners at 3,000 per spin are the most efficient scoring in the game.<br>For game progression, score goals by shooting lit features on whichever said has a white Offense ball light lit to advance up the field; if there is a yellow Defense light in the way, press the second flipper button to Pass the ball to the other side. In each of the three "pairs" of flippers, the left button operates the left flipper and the right button operates the right flipper.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Advancing the ball and Goals</h3>

<p>Striker is effectively split vertically into two playfields, the Left and the Right. To start, one of the two playfields will be lit for Left Offense. Hit lit standup targets, lit spinners, or top drop targets on the side of the table that is lit for Offense to move the white ball up the field. Each target or spin counts as 1 "step"; 3 steps moves the ball up the field one position. If the ball is advanced past the topmost white Offense light, one of the three top lanes will be lit for a Goal. Roll through a lit top lane to unlight it and score a Goal. One top lane will be lit for free at the start of the game, so you can get a goal off the first plunge.</p>

<p>The top yellow pop bumpers and yellow inserts represent the Defense. Hit a lit pop bumper or an unlit lower standup target to move the Defense one step closer to the Offense. If the Defense is exactly one step above the Offense, the game will prompt you to use one of the second flipper buttons to Pass the ball to the other side; this makes it easier to score a Goal, but it's not necessary. The number of Passes you have remaining is represented by the red inserts below the lower flipper sets; shooting the right saucer adds one more Pass, and up to 3 can be held at a time. If you advance the Offense to directly where the Defense is, both the Offense and Defense will flash for about 1 second. Hitting any lit target during this time will say "nice move" and the Defense will move up one step; otherwise, the Defense will move you down one step. If you take a lot of steps very quickly and run directly at the Defense, such as by shooting a lit spinner on the side where Offense is lit, you can occasionally run right by the Defense and advance to the goal unopposed.</p>

<p>Goals are the end of ball bonus, and the number of Goals you score is tracked throughout the game and does not reset. Each Goal is worth 1,000 points in end of ball bonus; this can be increased to 5,000, 10,000, or 15,000 points per Goal by clearing the center drop targets once, twice, or three times. The per-Goal value is reset to 1,000 at every ball. If you make 4 Goals in a single ball (or 5 Goals in a single ball, if you're playing a 5-ball game), the rollover lane between the center flipper pair will be lit for a Special.<br>After all players have played their final ball of the game, each player receives a Shootout bonus ball in proper turn. The Shootout is a timed bonus ball with unlimited ball save for as long as there is time on the clock. When the clock runs out, the flippers lock and the ball is allowed to drain. The Shootout clock starts at 5 seconds, and increases by 5 seconds for each Goal you scored during the game. If there is a maximum Shootout time, it is at least 65 seconds for a 12-Goal game. The clock is stopped while the ball is in the shooter lane, but there is no other way to pause or add time to the Shootout clock.</p>

<h3>Pinball scoring and features</h3>

<p>All pop bumpers score 3,000 points.<br>Top drop targets score 5,000 points in a 3-ball game or 3,000 in a 5-ball game. Completing either set of drop targets once lights the right saucer for Free Kick. Putting a ball in the lit Free Kick saucer locks it there and releases a second ball to the shooter lane. This effectively acts as a ball save/extra ball; there is no multiball on Striker. When the second ball leaves the playfield, the locked ball is kicked out of the Free Kick saucer, and your turn continues. Only one Free Kick can be qualified and used per turn.<br>Spinners score 3,000 per spin when lit, or 1,000 per spin when unlit. One of the two spinners is always lit. 10-point switches along the sides of the table alternate whether a spinner is lit or not. If a spinner is not lit, the lower side lane near the bottom of the table will be lit instead; like the spinner, these lanes score 3,000 when lit or 1,000 when unlit.<br>Lower standup targets score 3,000 when lit or 1,000 when unlit. Hitting a target toggles whether it is lit or not. Exactly 3 lower left targets and 3 lower right targets will be lit at all times, so hitting a target may cause a different target to toggle being lit as well.<br>Top lanes and the rollover lane between the center flippers score 5,000 points. Center drop targets score 5,000 in a 3-ball game or 3,000 in a 5-ball game.</p>

<p>In competition/novelty play, Specials score 100,000 points.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Striker has one of the most unique table bottoms ever seen in pinball. There are two entire flipper pairs. The left flipper button operates the left flipper in each pair. There are no out lanes; there are just two different center drains, between the flippers in each pair. Between the pairs of flippers in the horizontal center of the table directly above the drain is a rollunder switch; this switch allows the ball to freely move between the left flipper pair and the right flipper pair, which can be somewhat confusing and difficult to react to. It is possible, but not advised, to use one of the two outer lower flippers to intentionally pass the ball to the opposite flipper pair through the lower rollunder to get the pinball to the side where the Offense is. Depending on the game's flipper angle, it may also be possible for a ball "cradled" on one of the two inner flippers to roll off the back of the flipper, through the rollunder, and end up in control on the opposite flipper pair.</p>
