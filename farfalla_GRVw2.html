<h1 style="color:yellow;">Farfalla (Zaccaria, 1983)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Hit drop targets, they advance bonus. Completing red, yellow, and blue multiple times lights the Multispecial for 1,000,000 points. Completing the orange multiple times lights the orange special for 300,000 points or an extra ball. Bonus maxes at 20,000 and can be collected under the ramp. Bonus multiplier is supposed to be collected from top lanes, but more realistically you'll get it from lit in lanes. </p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top L-O-V-E lanes</h3>

<p>On the plunge, the ball will go through L, O, or V. The E lane actually takes the ball back up top for another trip down L, O, or V. Completing L-O-V-E advances the bonus multipler, to 5X, 10X, or 20X. Letters in L-O-V-E can also be spotted from lit in lanes- which is the only realistic way to get these letters, since the lanes are in no man's land and can't be shot for directly. </p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Two are lit, and two are not. Lit bumpers score 1,000 points, and every 5 hits to lit pop bumpers scores a bonus advance. Unlit bumpers score 100 points. A hidden switch in the horizontal rubber wall to the right of the red drop targets alternates which bumpers are lit.</p>

<h3>Red drop targets</h3>

<p>In the back left of the game. Each target down scores 800 points and a bonus advance. Completing the bank advances the progress toward the Red portion of the Multispecial and increases the value of each target in the bank for future completions up to 1,000 -> 3,000 -> 5,000 -> 8,000 per target.</p>

<h3>Blue drop targets</h3>

<p>Function identically to the red drop targets, with one addendum: behind the blue drop targets is a Move Ramp target, which lowers the ramp if the Special Bonus is not lit.</p>

<h3>Orange drop targets</h3>

<p>Similar to the red and blue targets: each target down is worth 800 the first time, 1,000 the second time, 3,000 the third time, and 5,000 the fourth. Completions of this bank do not work toward the Multispecial though, since this bank has its own Orange Special. The orange special is lit after 3 completions of the orange targets, at which point completing the bank again scores either 300,000 points or an extra ball and unlights the orange targets completely.</p>

<h3>Ramp and Special Bonus lane</h3>

<p>The ramp starts in the up position, revealing the Special Bonus lane. The Special Bonus lane scores 10,000 points when not lit. If the base bonus is maxed out at 20,000 points, Special Bonus is lit; going through the Special Bonus lane scores the entire current bonus with multiplier and resets both the base bonus count and the multiplier. Collecting a lit Special bonus also spots a completion of whatever colour target bank has the least progress toward Multispecial. </p>

<p>When Special Bonus is not lit, hitting either Move Ramp target- on the left side of the playfield, or behind the blue targets- lowers the ramp, blocking off the Special Bonus lane. Going up the ramp to the upper playfield raises the ramp. Lighting Special Bonus when the ramp is down does not immediately raise the ramp, but the ramp cannot be lowered if Special Bonus is lit. </p>

<h3>Upper playfield</h3>

<p>Each yellow target on the upper playfield scores 30,000 points. Any completion of the bank, even across multiple trips to the upper playfield, advances the yellow lights toward Multispecial. Completing the entire bank of 6 targets in a single trip lights the upper special at the standup in the top left of the upper playfield, which scores 150,000 points or an extra ball.</p>

<h3>Multispecial target</h3>

<p>Completing the red, yellow, and blue targets the requisite number of times- could be 1, 2, or 4- lights the standup target to the right of the ramp for Multispecial, which can be set to a replay, an extra ball, or 1,000,000 points. Scores 5,000 points when not lit.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table and React!</h3>

<p>The in lanes and out lanes are in their usual order, but notice that part of the in/out lane dividing rail is a literal entire flipper. When an out lane is lit, React! is ready, meaning you get one chance at a well timed flip on that side where the flipper will flip outwards and fling the ball back up the out lane. Doing this unlights said out lane. Both out lanes can be relit by completing any bank of drop targets.<br>The in lanes spot letters in L-O-V-E when lit. Only one will be lit at a time, and slingshots switch them. 

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Completing L-O-V-E advances bonus multiplier to 5X, 10X, or 20X. Bonus multiplier is not carried from ball to ball. Any drop target, plus every 5 hits to a lit bumper, advances base bonus count up to a maximum of 20. Base bonus can be carried from ball to ball. Max bonus is 20x 20,000 = 400,000 points. The full bonus including multiplier can be collected, but is reset, at the lit Special Bonus lane.</p>

<h3>Game Time Bonus</h3>

<p>On ball 3, the high score display will show a value that starts at 10. Every 3 switch hits on ball 3 increases this count by 1. This is the Game Time Bonus. After ball 3 drains, a special timed ball 4 will be given; the displayed count equals the number of half-seconds that ball 4 will be available. If an extra ball is earned during the Game Time Bonus, the clock will stop until the current ball in play drains. If an extra ball is earned on ball 3, the timer cannot be built further until all extra balls have been used.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>Multispecial can score 1,000,000 points, a free game, an extra ball, or "Super Bonus". Orange special has the same options, but with 300,000 points instead of 1,000,000 as an option. <br>The Super Bonus doesn't score points, and instead just lights up the words Super Bonus on the backglass; this was used in European markets with different definitions of gambling to give free food or drink to a player. </p>

<p>Multispecial can require 1, 2, or 4 completions of each drop target bank. Orange special can require 1, 2, or 3 completions of the orange targets to be lit.</p>

<p>Max extra balls stored at once can be set to 1 or 3.</p>
