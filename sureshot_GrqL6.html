<h1>Sure Shot / Bank Shot (Gottlieb, 1976)</h1>

<p>Sure Shot is the replay version. Bank Shot is the add-a-ball version. This guide was written primarily with Sure Shot in mind. Differences in Bank Shot are detailed at the end of the page.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Top priority is plunging the 1 ball, since the top center lane is the only way to get it. Collect as many pool balls as possible. Once this is done, shoot the saucers repeatedly. Completing the entire 1-15 rack lights the specials on Sure Shot and the add-a-balls on Bank Shot.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Pool balls</h3>

<p>Numbered pool balls are all over the playfield. The top lanes give 4-2-1-3-5, from left to right. 6, 10, 11, and 9 are found in various side lanes around the playfield. Three standup targets around the playfield award two balls each: 13+7 in the lower left, 12+15 in the center, and 8+14 in the lower right. The out lanes are an additional way to get 4 and 5, and the in lanes also give 2 and 3.</p>

<p>On the plunge, top priority is getting the 1 from the center lane, since that's the only place it can be collected. Honorable mentions are the 4 and 5 on the sides, since the alternate method of collecting those is the out lanes. </p>

<p>Any pool ball shot (target or rollover, already collected or not) scores 500 points.</p>

<p>End of ball bonus is equal to 1,000 points per collected ball. If all 15 have been collected, the saucers and center top lane will be lit for a special (rotating between them). </p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>The bumpers score 100 points, or 1,000 when lit. The two top bumpers are lit by collecting all of the 1-5 pool balls. The lower bumper is lit by collecting the 6-9 pool balls.</p>

<h3>Saucers</h3>

<p>The saucers score points based on whether balls are lit along the edges of the rack as seen in the center of the playfield. 100 points is scored if a ball is not lit/collected, and 1,000 points is scored if it is. The left saucer looks at the 4, 6, 10, 13, and 15 balls. The right saucer looks at the 5, 9, 11, 14, and 15 balls. In a good game, these saucers give a repeatable 4,100 or 5,000 points per hit, so if the eject is safe, go for these all day after building up a collection of pool balls.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Sure Shot has a conventional in lane/out lane setup.  All in/out lanes score 500 points. The left out lane, left in lane, right in lane, and right out lane score the 4, 2, 3, and 5 balls respectively.</p>

<h3>Bonus</h3>

<p>Bonus is simply 1,000 per lit pool ball. There is no way to multiply the bonus. Lit pool balls, and therefore the bonus count, are carried forward from ball to ball.</p>

<h2>Differences between Sure Shot and Bank Shot</h2>

<p>The only scoring difference I am aware of on Bank Shot's playfield versus Sure Shot's is that bumpers on Bank Shot are always lit and worth 100 points.</p>

<p>On Bank Shot, completing 1-15 balls lights both saucers and the top center lane for Wow, which can be set to an extra ball or 50,000 points. The saucer Wows can be collected repeatedly, but unlight at the end of the ball. The top 1 lane Wow stays from ball to ball, but unlights once collected. When the ball drains once all 15 balls are lit, they will be unlit for the next ball, with the exception of the 2, 3, 7, 8, 13, and 14 balls, and the player must try to complete a second rack of pool balls from there. (Needing to collect the 1, 4, and 5 all again makes this unlikely at best.)</p>
