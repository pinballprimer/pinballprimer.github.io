<h2>Game rules</h2>

<p>Advance the hockey puck one step toward the Goal by hitting the top passive bumper, either side lane, the currently lit rollover button, or either out lane. If less than 5 advances toward the current Goal have been made, the top lanes will be lit for 3 advances and the center pop bumper will be lit for 1 advance. Making a total of 10 advances scores one Goal, which lights the center pop bumper for 1,000 points per hit. If playing exclusively for score, focus on hitting this pop bumper when lit as many times as possible. When a Goal is scored and the center pop bumper is lit, making either upper side lane returns the puck to center ice, which enables the ability to advance toward another Goal but reverts the center pop bumper value back to 100 points. Preset goal counts, which are operator adjustable to any number from 1 to 9, can score a Special, worth either a free game or 10,000 points.</p>

<p>The left top lane collects A, and the right top lane collects B. Collecting A lights the upper left and lower right pop bumpers for 100 points instead of 10, and lights the lower left wall switch for 1,000 points. Collecting B lights the upper right and lower left pop bumpers for 100 points and lights the lower right wall switch for 1,000 points. Collecting both A and B in the same ball opens the gate in the right out lane; using the gate resets A and B, and also resets the puck to center ice if a Goal was just scored. There's no easy way back to the top of the table, so opening the out lane gate is immensely difficult.</p>

<p>The standup targets in the top corners of the table raise a center post between the flippers, which completely blocks the flipper gap. The post is lowered when the rollover button near the post is pressed or when the ball drains down an out lane. There are no in lanes; full size 3 inch flippers back up directly to the slingshots. There is no end of ball bonus. Tilt ends the current ball in play only. There is no extra ball feature.</p>
