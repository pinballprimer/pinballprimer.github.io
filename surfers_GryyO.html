<h1>Surfers (Bally, 1967)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Surf Side (Gottlieb, 1967), Surfer/Surf Champ (Gottlieb, 1976), or Surf 'n Safari (Premier Gottlieb, 1991).</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Hit blue mushroom bumpers, or hit white mushroom bumpers after making the Hang Five top saucer, to advance the Ring-a-Ding value in the upper right. If you can help it, don't max out the value at 500 points; the value only resets when a 500 is collected. Blue and lit white mushroom bumpers also award Surfs letters; spell Surfs to light Balloons. Certain Balloon thresholds can score 500 points, an extra ball, or a free game. Keep the flippers zipped together as much as possible; the red mushroom closes the flippers and the yellow mushrooms open them.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>On the plunge: Hang Five top saucer</h3>

<p>The Hang Five top saucer scores 100 points, lights the white mushroom bumpers, and fires the ball at the upper flipper. A well-timed upper flipper usage can put the ball back into the saucer, making this a repeatable 100 points. A ball that comes down from the top of the playfield to the right of the Hang Five saucer will gently feed the upper flipper, but a ball that goes left of the Hang Five saucer will fall directly into the pop bumpers.</p>

<h3>Mushroom bumpers</h3>

<p>Blue mushroom bumpers (top left and middle right) score 10 points, award a letter in Surfs, and advance the value of the Ring-a-Ding in the upper right. <br>If S-U-R-F is lit in Surfs, the left out lane kickback is lit; using the kickback does not unlight it, the only way to unlight it is to collect another Surfs letter. Spelling Surfs in full awards one Balloon on the backglass. There are 9 Balloons in total; reaching specific operator-chosen thresholds between 3 and 9 will score either a free game, an extra ball, or 500 points. Collecting the 9th Balloon resets all Balloons. Lit Balloons are carried over from game to game.<br>The Ring-a-Ding value at the upper right saucer is advanced in the order 10-100-200-300-500. Making the saucer scores the lit value. If the lit value is maxed at 500, collecting the Ring-a-Ding resets the value back to 10. If the Ring-a-Ding value is 200 or 300 points <i>and</i> the flippers are not currently zipped together, the lower right rollover button will open the gate in the right out lane.</p>

<p>White mushroom bumpers (both in the top left) score 10 points when not lit. Making the Hang Five saucer lights the white mushroom bumpers for the rest of the ball. When lit, white mushroom bumpers score 100 points and a Surfs letter, but do not advance the Ring-a-Ding value. Draining the ball unlights the white bumpers.</p>

<p>The red mushroom bumper scores no points, but zips the flippers together, blocking off the center drain. The yellow mushroom bumpers in the lower left and right score 100 points and reopen the flippers.</p>

<h3>Pop bumpers</h3>

<p>Pop bumpers are always lit. The lower green pop bumper scores 10 points. The two upper yellow pop bumpers always score 1.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Surfers has no in lanes. Flippers back up directly to the slingshots. Slingshots score 1 point. The red mushroom bumper zips the flippers together, while the yellow mushroom bumpers reopen the flippers.</p>

<p>The left out lane scores 50 points when not lit. If it is lit, the left out lane scores 100 points and has an automatic kickback that fires the ball back into play. The kickback is only lit if the current status of spelling Surfs is exactly S-U-R-F.</p>

<p>The right out lane always scores 50 points. There is a gate in the right out lane that redirects the ball back to the shooter lane for a replunge. Using the gate awards one Surfs letter and closes the gate. To open the gate, you must press the lower right rollover button when the Ring-a-Ding value is 200 or 300 and the flippers are not currently zipped together. If the gate is already open when the flippers are zipped, the gate will close, and it will automatically reopen when the flippers are unzipped.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus. Tilt can be set to end the ball in play or the whole game.</p>
