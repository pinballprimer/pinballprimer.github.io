<h1>Casino Royale (Segasa Sonic, 1976)</h1>

<h2>Game rules</h2>

<p>The top rollover button and the outer standup targets near the bumpers advance the bonus. Base bonus maxes at 100,000 points (each bonus advance is worth 10,000 rather than the typical 1,000). Making a top lane scores 1,000 points and lights one corresponding bumper for 1,000 points instead of 100. Lighting all 3 bumpers awards Double Bonus. Bumpers and Double Bonus are reset at the end of the ball, and there is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>

<p>The center Spinner advances on its own; hit the lower left standup target to stop it if it is in motion, and hit the inner top standup targets to restart it if it is stopped. Whether it is stopped or not, shoot the center saucer to earn whatever Spinner award is currently lit. Possible awards include 5,000 points, 10,000 points, 50,000 points, an extra ball, a free game, or Special. Special is by far the best award; it lights the left orbit, upper right side lane, and both out lanes for 50,000 points for the rest of the ball, when they only score 5,000 otherwise.</p>

<p>There is no left in lane. The right in lane always scores 5,000 points. The flipper gap is slightly wider than on most other machines of the era. Tilt ends the ball in play only.</p>
