<h1>Ice-Revue (1965) / Ice Show (1966), by Gottlieb</h1>

<p>Ice-Revue is the replay version. Ice Show is the much rarer add-a-ball version. This guide focuses primarily on Ice-Revue. Differences observed in Ice Show are mentioned at the end of the guide.
<br>Ice-Revue is commonly mislabelled online as Ice Review.
<br>These games are not to be confused with Ice Fever (Premier Gottlieb, 1985).</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Try to light as many bumpers as possible by plunging into a different top lane each time. Getting the ball stuck in the nest of 10-point bumpers is a decent way to score. Hit 1-6 targets to unlight them; completing the sequence lights the center saucers, which can be worth 100 points, 200 points, or Special (free game, but no points). Center saucers are not worth going for when they are unlit and score only 50 points.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes and bumpers</h3>

<p>Top lanes score 5 points. Making a top lane lights the corresponding bumper for 10 points instead of 1, as indicated by the arrows on the playfield. Notice that the center top bumper (lit by the middle top lane) is a passive bumper, not a pop bumper. Lighting all 5 bumpers causes one of the top lanes to be lit, rotating each time any bumper is hit; making the lit top lane scores a Special, which as far as I know, can only be worth a free game, not points. Since there are 5 top lanes and no reliable way to get back to the top lanes other than at the start of a ball, you are required to have some pop bumper luck (or nudge appropriately) to get a bumper to send the ball back up through a top lane for a chance to earn more than one on a single trip for it to be possible to play for this Special.</p>

<h3>1-6 numbers and center saucers</h3>

<p>The standup targets along the sides of the table are labelled 1-2-3-4-5-6 and all score 10 points. Hit a lit target to unlight it. The 1, 2, 5, and 6 each light one of the four out lanes, from left to right respectively, for 50 points instead of 5. The center saucers score 50 points when not lit. Collecting all of 1-2-3-4-5-6 lights the center saucers for the rest of the game. Center saucers can be lit for 100 points, 200 points, or Special (free game, but no points). Making a saucer itself or going through a rollover lane anywhere in the game changes which award is lit at the saucers. The two saucers' rewards rotate in opposite directions; 1/3 of the time, both will be lit for 200 points, and the other 2/3 of the time, one will be lit for Special while the other is lit for 100 points. Center saucers fire the ball at speed toward the opposite flipper.</p>

<p>Supposedly, on a 3-ball game of Ice-Revue, 1-6 targets are tied together into three pairs (1 & 6, 2 & 5, 3 & 4), and collecting either number in a pair gives credit for both, to make it easier to light the Special at the center saucers. I have not been able to confirm if this is accurate.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>On a production copy of Ice-Revue, there are 4 out lanes; two on each side. All out lanes score 5 points or 50 when lit. The four out lanes are lit when the 1, 2, 5, and 6 respectively are collected. The triangular structures next to the flippers are not slingshots; they are regular bouncing rubbers that score 1 point. The game's slingshots are slightly further up the table, on the edges just below the 1 and 6 targets.</p>

<p>On prototype copies of Ice-Revue, there are 6 out lanes; three on each side. Like the production game, they score 5 points or 50 when lit. The six out lanes are lit when 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 respectively are collected. The triangular rubbers next to the flippers are completely missing. To compensate for there being two more out lanes, the posts between the out lanes are considerably larger, allowing more possiblities for nudge saves.</p>

<p>There is no extra ball feature of end of ball bonus.</p>

<h3>Differences observed in Ice Show, the add-a-ball version</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Top lanes score 10 points instead of 5. Top lanes are only lit to indicate that the bumper corresponding to that lane is <i>not</i> yet lit. Lighting all 5 bumpers resets them and awards 1 extra ball.</li>
	<li>1-6 targets score 50 points instead of 10.</li>
	<li>The center saucers are always lit. The Special award at the saucers has been replaced with 300 points.</li>
	<li>There are 6 out lanes instead of 4, like the setup on the prototype copies of Ice-Revue. On Ice Show, however, 1-6 numbers can be earned at the out lanes in addition to the standup targets. Ice Show's out lanes always score 50 points. Collecting all of 1-6 resets the sequence and awards 1 extra ball.</li>
	<li>A fourth score reel was added, increasing the maximum displayable score from 1,999 on Ice-Revue to 9,999 on Ice Show.</li>
</ul>
