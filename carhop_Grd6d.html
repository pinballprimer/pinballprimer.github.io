<h1>Car Hop (Premier Gottlieb, 1991)</h1>

<p>This game can be played in Past or Present mode. Rules and scoring below are for Present mode. Past mode uses a different sound package with bells and chimes and divides all scoring by 1,000 compared to Present mode.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>The biggest scoring on Car Hop comes from the spinner 3-way combo: shoot the Loop via the lane just right of the center Bullseye target, which feeds the left flipper, then shoot the right lane to hit the top right drop target, then use the upper flipper as the ball comes back down to shoot the spinner in the upper left. If you do all three without missing, the spinner scores 100,000 points per spin, and if you make the combo two consecutive times, the spinner scores 200,000 per spin instead. All other scoring modes should be timed out by comparison.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>On the plunge</h3>

<p>The skill shot is a precise-power plunge that triggers the rollover lane which cuts across the u-turn in the upper left of the playfield. Doing so instantly starts the currently selected Icepop mode, which can be rotated with the right flipper while the ball is in the shooter lane.</p>

<p>A very short plunge will come down the right in lane to the right flipper, which is not advised. A successful skill shot, or a plunge that was too strong to make the skill shot, goes all the way around the u-turn and makes its way to the upper right flipper. If you shoot the ball directly at the spinner in the upper left without hitting any other switches along the way, the spinner scores 100,000 points per spin, which can be worth over 2,000,000 points just for starting the ball.</p>

<h3>Icepop modes</h3>

<p>To start an Icepop mode, clear both 5-banks of drop targets. When no mode is running, the two target banks are tied together, meaning hitting a drop target in one bank causes the same drop target in the other bank to automatically fall down. The flashing icepop represents the currently selected mode, which can be rotated by the right flipper on the plunge, the left standup targets, or by the switch above the right in lane.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Extra Ball Round: the 2nd and 3rd targets in each 5-bank (counting from the top) are raised. You have 9 long seconds (about 20 real seconds) to knock down all 4 drop targets; each one must be hit separately. Succeeding awards an instant extra ball.</li>
	<li>Heat: see Heat Wave below.</li>
	<li>Special Round: the highest and lowest targets in each 5-bank are raised. You have 9 long seconds (about 20 real seconds) to knock down all 4 drop targets for an instant Special.</li>
	<li>Wave: see Heat Wave below.</li>
	<li>Points Round: the center targets in each bank are raised, and a timer of 5 long seconds (about 12 real seconds) starts. Hit a drop target to restart the timer. Hit both drop targets to score the currently displayed value and reset both targets. The value starts at 250,000 points and doubles each time it is collected, up to a maximum of 8,000,000 points. The 8,000,000 level is completed repeatedly until the mode ends; the mode only ends when the ball is drained or ~12 seconds pass without a drop target being hit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Heat and Wave modes do nothing on their own, but starting both of them causes both lower saucers to be lit for Heat Wave, which is the closest think Car Hop has to a wizard mode. In Heat Wave, you have 20 long seconds (about 40-45 real seconds) to collect 15 degree advances. Degree advances are indicated by the suns on the playfield: the Loop (just right of the center bullseye) and the u-turn shot on the right award 1 degree advance, while the center bullseye target awards 2. Collecting 15 advances in the time limit completes the mode. The completion bonus for Heat Wave is displayed before the mode starts: if your score when starting Heat Wave is between 3,000,000 and 50,000,000 points, the completion bonus is Double Your Score, otherwise the completion bonus is 3,000,000 points.</p>

<p>At the end of the ball, your end of ball bonus is equal to 100,000 points per mode in the currently completed set, plus 10,000 points per drop target that was knocked down toward collecting the next Icepop. Collecting all 5 icepops scores an instant 1,000,000 points and resets all the icepops so the modes can be played again, which removes your built-up bonus. Since this game has no bonus multiplier, the 1,000,000 completion bonus is better than the possible 500,000 points in end of ball bonus.</p>

<h3>Loop shot and spinner, including spinner combo</h3>

<p>The loop shot consists of using either lower flipper to shoot the lane just right of the bullseye target, which returns to the left in lane via the left side of the playfield. Making this loop repeatedly without hitting any other switches in between scores an increasing value: 50,000, then 100,000, then a repeatable 250,000 until you miss. Making the loop also raises the single drop target in the u-turn in the upper right. If you shoot the u-turn immediately after making the loop, knocking down the lone drop target will light the spinner in the upper left for 100,000 points per spin, but only until a non-spinner switch is hit. If you make this 3-way combo twice in a row without interruption, the spinner will be lit for 200,000 points per spin the second time. This is ludicrous value, and is the only thing that should be practiced or aimed for on Car Hop.<br>When the spinner is not lit and no mode is running, it scores 10,000 points per spin. If any mode is running, the spinner scores 1,000 points per spin and the loop combo is not available for lighting it.</p>

<p>If you make the loop shot but the ball drains down the left out lane due to the crossover geometry of the bottom left of the table, you get the ball back for free as a drain shield. The left out lane lights purple briefly to indicate this.</p>

<h3>Lining up Burgers</h3>

<p>The left saucer moves the left burger up one step, and the right saucer does the same for the right burger, as shown on the playfield. The center burger is moved by making the Loop shot or any slingshot. Whenever all three burgers are on the same white row, the center bullseye target scores 1,000,000 points. If all three burgers are on the top purple row, the Loop shot is lit for extra ball.</p>

<h3>Select a Feature and Mystery</h3>

<p>At the start of the ball, both lower saucers are lit for Select a Feature. Hitting a slingshot alternates whether the saucers are lit for Select a Feature or Mystery. Collecting either Select a Feature or Mystery unlights that saucer, and you will not be able to collect Select a Feature or Mystery from that saucer for the rest of the ball.<br>In Select a Feature, the alphanumeric display shows you an award; for 5 seconds, you can press the right flipper to reroll for a new award, or press the left flipper to collect. If time runs out, the currently displayed award is auto-collected. In Mystery, the game just picks an award for you instead from the same pool. Below are awards I've seen in Select a Feature or Mystery: the list is likely not exhuastive.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Bullseye Round: this is the default option in Select a Feature, and usually the best one. For 9 long seconds (about 20 real seconds), the bullseye target scores 1,000,000 points per hit. Making the 3-way combo- Loop -> u-turn -> ending at the bullseye target instead of the spinner scores a double bullseye worth 2,000,000 points.</li>
	<li>Points: 1,000 or 500,000</li>
	<li>Line em up Points: all three burgers are put on the same white row, lighting the bullseye target for 1,000,000 points.</li>
	<li>Line em up Extra Ball: all three burgers are put on the purple row, lighting the Loop for extra ball.</li>
	<li>Count-Up: a quick around that ends as soon as the bullseye target is hit once. The value of that bullseye target counts up quickly from 100,000 to 1,000,000 in increments of 10,000, then counts up 1,000,000 at a time up to a maximum of 10,000,000 before abruptly timing out. Despite the chance of a big reward, this is too difficult and precise to go out of your way for.</li>
	<li>Spot Heat or Wave: instantly gives credit for the Icepop in question toward end of ball bonus and qualifying the Heat Wave mode.</li>
	<li>Icepop: starts the currently selected Icepop mode for free.</li>
	<li>Award Extra Ball: given instantly.</li>
	<li>Double Your Score: a very rare award. May only appear from Mystery, and not from Select a Feature?</li>
	<li>Ketchup: this is a rare award that can only be given in a multiplayer game, and only if you are not currently the player in the lead. Ketchup instantly increases your score to put you in a tie with the game's current leader. The existence of this award means that in a tournament setting, Car Hop should always be played as a single-player-only game.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Carhop letters and jackpot</h3>

<p>The jackpot starts at 1,000,000 points and increases by 100,000 each time a new ball is played. The jackpot rolls over from player to player and game to game, with a maximum of at least 9,000,000 points. Each slingshot hit changes which letter in CAR*HOP (including the star) is selected. If the selected letter has not already been lit (see the lower left of the backglass), it can be collected at the bullseye target. Complete CAR*HOP to score and reset the jackpot.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Car Hop has an almost-conventional in/out lane setup, with in lanes that slant slightly toward the edges of the table. The star rollovers that form in lane switches score 1,000 points. Out lanes score 100,000 points. Making the Loop shot, or making the u-turn shot when the solo drop target is not raised, lights the left and right out lanes respectively for a brief drain shield, saving the ball and allowing you to shoot again if the ball chokes up at the in/out lane crossover and falls into the out lane.</p>

<h3>End of ball bonus</h3>

<p>Bonus is counted as 100,000 points for each lit Icepop on the current trip through the game's modes, plus 10,000 points for each 5-bank drop target that was knocked down on route to starting the next mode. There is no bonus multiplier or mid-ball bonus collect. Completing all 5 modes and collecting the 1,000,000 bonus resets the completed mode progress, which accordingly resets the end of ball bonus.</p>

<p>In competition/novelty play, extra balls and specials score 1,000,000 points.</p>
