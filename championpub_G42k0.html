<h1>The Champion Pub (Bally Williams, 1998)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Shooting the punching bag, left orbit, or left ramp when lit are part of your (the playable boxer's) training, which fills your life bar. When the life bar is full, the lower left scoop or either orbit starts a fight. During a fight, the center punching bag rotates to show a boxer caricature. Hit the boxer's gut to do small damage; use the center green mini-ramps to do moderate damage; or, since the orbits turn into u-turn ramps during fights, combo the orbits back and forth to qualify the green mini-ramps for an instant win knockout punch.<br>If playing casually for game progression, work through the fights at your own desired pace. Winning 5 fights is the main requirement for Ultimate Challenge wizard mode.<br>If playing in a competitive setting, use the lower left scoop to raise the Purse award for winning a fight, and use the right orbit to lock balls for multiball and get more skill shots which can double the Purse; winning one very strong fight is more efficient in a competitive setting than trying to quickly win several low-value fights.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>Press and hold the launch button on the front of the game to start the skill shot. When you release the button, the ball will launch and the award that is within the box on the left of the DMD is what you will receive as a skill shot. There is a little bit of lead time on when the wheel actually stops after you let go of the button; try to let go about half a panel before the award you actually want.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The number 10: literally just 10 points. Honestly more insulting than just getting nothing.</li>
	<li>The letter M: an instant 1,000,000 points. Tempting, but unless you're 1,000,000 points away from winning a match, there are more enticing options.</li>
	<li>2X Purse: doubles the Purse award given for the next fight, up to a maximum of 60,000,000 points.</li>
	<li>+5X: 5 end-of-ball bonus multipliers.</li>
	<li>A fist: receive 1 Smart Punch, usable during Fights described later on.</li>
	<li>A dollar sign ($): light all 3 Jackpots at the left ramp, punching bag, and right orbit. Jackpots lit in this way go away once collected.</li>
	<li>An exclamation mark (!): starts the Shadow Boxing mini-mode described much later in the guide.</li>
	<li>A door: awards the Door Prize mystery award. This is usually the best option for casual play.<ul>
		<li>Light Spitting Gallery or Light Poker Night: video modes that are started at the lower left scoop.</li>
		<li>Smart Punch: same as the fist icon in the regular skill shot.</li>
		<li>Light Second Wind: lights one out lane for a ball saver and +3 health, usable one time.</li>
		<li>Light Lock: prepares the next lock for Multi-Brawl at the right orbit.</li>
		<li>Six Health: as described.</li>
		<li>Light Start Fight: your health bar is maxed out, lighting Start Fight at the lower left scoop and both orbits.</li></ul>
</ul>

<h3>Jackpots and Multi-Brawl standard multiball</h3>

<p>Jackpots can be collected any time there is not a fight or multiball running. When this is the case, one of the two in lanes will be lit, alternating with each slingshot hit. A lit left in lane lights the right orbit for jackpot, and a lit right in lane lights the left ramp for a jackpot. Jackpots lit in this way are eligible for about 5 seconds; making the jackpot keeps it lit until about 5 seconds pass without it being scored again.</p>

<p>At the start of the game, lock for Multi-Brawl are lit automatically at the right orbit; lock 3 balls to start Multi-Brawl standard multiball. For the second Multi-Brawl, you must complete the beer standup targets on the right (by hitting all 3 once each to light them) to qualify all 3 locks. For the third Multi-Brawl onward, you must complete the beer targets before being able to lock each ball. There is no lock stealing in The Champion Pub- if you make your third lock when there are not already two balls in the lock, the remaining balls will be autoplunged to get you to 3 ball play- but you only get another skill shot after making a lock if there are not already 2 balls in the lock channel, which means different players may get different numbers of skill shots despite doing the same things in a multiplayer game. With features like 2x Purse always available in the skill shot, this disparity can mean a gain or loss of millions of points.</p>

<p>Multi-Brawl always starts as a 3-ball multiball. Multi-Brawl can be stacked with any multiball, but you must either start Multi-Brawl first or have 2 balls locked for Multi-Brawl when you start the other multiball. Multi-Brawl can even be stacked with <i>itself</i> if you lock 2 balls, receive Multi-Brawl from a Poker Night award, then start Multi-Brawl again with lock #3. When any multiballs are stacked, balls are autoplunged until there are 4 balls in play (not 3) when any multiball other than the first one is started.</p>

<p>In Multi-Brawl, all three jackpots (left ramp, punching bag, and right orbit) are lit. Making a jackpot unlights it; making all 3 jackpots relights all of them. Multi-Brawl and single ball play in lane jackpots use the same progression, which is built up throughout the game for each player; the first jackpot scores 100,000 points, and each subsequent jackpot is worth 100,000 more than the previous. Each jackpot is named, and in order you'll score a Single, Double, Triple, Quadruple, Quintuple, Sextuple, Septuple, Octuple, Super, Mega, Ultra, Turbo, Maximum, and Cow-of-a-Jackpot as the first 14. From then on, all jackpots are Jackpot Deluxes worth 1,500,000 points. Collecting your first Jackpot Deluxe also comes with a 500,000 points bonus for Jackpots Complete, which is one of the 5 requirements to play Ultimate Challenge wizard mode.</p>

<h3>Training and Fights, including Cash Fights and Ultimate Challenge wizard mode</h3>

<p>There are three flavors of Training available: Jump Rope at the left orbit, Speed Bag at the left ramp, and Heavy Bag at the punching bag toy. Shoot any one when lit to take part in that training, which helps fill your player's life bar. Once you "pass" a training, you cannot play it again until you pass the other two trainings, even if your life bar is not filled yet.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Jump Rope:</b> shoot the left orbit. The ball will be popped to a pedestal in the far upper left corner of the game. A curved metal bar will rotate. Use the flippers to make the ball jump over the metal bar. The metal bar will change speeds periodically. Each successful jump where the ball lands back on the pedestal without falling off counts as one jump, even if you didn't actually clear the bar. Every jump adds 1 health to the player's life bar. Making a total of 6 jumps across multiple trips counts as completing the Jump Rope. Making 10 jumps in one trip doubles the current fight's Purse. Making 20 jumps in one visit awards a Smart Punch. The person with the most jumps in one visit, or the most recent person to score the maximum of 30 jumps in one trip, gets to enter their initials at the end of the game.</li>
	<li><b>Speed Bag:</b> shoot the left ramp. The ball will be diverted to a mini-playfield in the far upper right corner of the game. Use the flippers to "flip" the two pads at the bottom of the mini-playfield. Each hit to the target at the back counts as one hit of Speed Bag and awards 1 health. The ball leaves Speed Bag by draining out the bottom, and after about 7 seconds of Speed Bag, the "flippers" are shut off so the ball can drain. Making 6 hits to Speed Bag (can be across multiple trips) completes the Speed Bag; making 10 hits in one trip doubles the current Purse; making 20 hits in one trip awards a Smart Punch; the person with the most hits in one visit, or the most recent person to score the maximum 30 hits, gets to enter their initials at the end of the game.</li>
	<li><b>Heavy Bag:</b> it takes 10 hits to the punching bag toy to complete Heavy Bag. You can only get credit for hits toward completing Heavy Bag during single ball play when the health bar is not already full.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also receive 1/2 of a health point, indicated by a flashing light, by shooting the lower left scoop. Completing all 3 forms of training awards 500,000 points and is one of the 5 requirements toward Ultimate Challenge wizard mode.</p>

<p>The default value for the Purse bonus is 500,000 points times the current fight number. Shooting the left scoop when Start Fight is not lit, completing the three Beer targets on the right of the playfield, or shooting the left ramp <i>during</i> a fight adds half of that fight's default value to the Purse (250,000 for the first fight, 375,000 for the second, etc.). The current Purse can be doubled from a skill shot award, by making 10 jumps in one trip to Jump Rope or 10 hits in one hit to Speed Bag, or scoring a Pair in Poker Night. Collecting a Straight Flush in Poker Night instantly maxes out the Purse at 60,000,000 points. The Purse cannot be increased to more than 60,000,000 in any of the first five fights. If you win the fight, you score the current Purse value; if you lose, the Purse is lost and reset to (500,000 times fight number) for the next fight.</p>

<p>When your health bar is full, Start Fight is lit. A fight can be started at the lower left scoop or either orbit, or if the ball falls into the shooter lane for a replunge from Against the Ropes in the lower right. Everything pauses while your opponent is introduced. There are 10 possible computer-controlled opponents: they each have their own ranking based on their records against other players on the machine. As far as I can tell, there's no difference in the fighters other than their names and quotes, with fight speed and difficulty just based on how many fights you (the player) have won. Your first fight will be against either #10 or #9; second fight will be against #8 or #7; third fight will be against #6 or #5; fourth fight will be #4, #3, or #2; fifth fight will always be against #1.</p>

<p>During a fight, the computer boxer will punch you every few seconds, doing 1 or 2 or 3 damage from your 12-point life bar. Your goal is to deplete the opponent's 12-point life bar before he does the same to you. The center post is raised for a few seconds at the start of each fight. Shooting the pinball at the boxer's stomach scores a Gut Shot, worth 100,000 points and taking away 1 (or sometimes 2 in early fights) of the enemy's health. Using the green hook ramps to hit the boxer in the head, or using a Smart Punch by pressing the launch button if you've earned one, scores a Head Shot worth 500,000 points and taking away 2 (or sometimes 3 in early fights) of the opponent's health. <br>During a fight, the orbit shots turn into u-turn ramps which immediately feed the ball back into the near in lane. Repeatedly shooting these Jab shots back and forth is a Jab combo. <b>If the center post between the flippers is raised and the machine is well-maintained, simply allowing the ball to rest against the center post and then flipping the flipper should get the ball up a Jab ramp 100% of the time.</b> Making a 2-way Jab combo lights Knockout; making a Head Shot or using a Smart Punch when Knockout is lit instantly defeats your boxer opponent. Knocking out at least one opponent is one of the five requirements for Ultimate Challenge wizard mode. After knocking out a boxer with the Jab combo, it will take one more comboed Jab shot to light Knockout in the future.<br>In a pinch, you can add health points back to your life bar by shooting the lower left scoop, the left ramp, or completing the Beer targets during a fight. Shooting the ramp during a fight also increases the Purse by half of the fight's default value.</p>

<p>If you run out of health during a fight, you lose the fight and must re-train to try again, but you do not immediately lose your ball. If the ball drains during a fight, you are instantly knocked out; you lose the fight, and 6 health from your life bar, and your turn ends. The only exception to this drain rule is if you go down an out lane lit for Second Wind, in which case you are given 3 health and a ball saver.<br>If you win a fight, you receive the Purse for that fight, plus an additional 1,000,000 points if you won by knockout, plus an additional 500,000 points if it was your first knockout since this lights a jewel on the Ultimate Challenge belt. Finally, you receive a special award based on which fight you just won:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Light Spittin' Gallery video mode at the lower left scoop</li>
	<li>Light Extra Ball: also at the lower left scoop</li>
	<li>Start Raid Multiball: a 3-ball multiball. All switches in the game score 5,000 points. Hitting any switch scores the current switch value and adds 1,000 to it, up to 50,000 points per switch, until single ball play resumes.</li>
	<li>Start Contender Challenge: all 7 shots are lit for a hurry-up. The hurry-up starts at 1,000,000 points and counts down to 25,000 over about 15 seconds. Make any lit shot to score the current hurry-up value and reset it. As soon as one hurry-up times out or the ball drains, the whole mode ends. If you collect all 7 hurry-ups, Start Fight is instantly lit.</li>
	<li>Champion Multiball: a 4-ball multiball with generous ball saver. All scoring rules from Multi-Brawl, Raid Multiball, and Fisticuffs Multiball are in effect, plus a bonus of 1,000,000 points for making any of the 7 major shots. Lasts until there is only one ball in play.</li>
</ol>
<p>On some machines with a loose tilt setting, you may be able to get hits on the boxer's stomach simply by nudging the machine forward and backward.</p>

<h4>Ultimate Challenge</h4>
<p>There are 5 requirements to play Ultimate Challenge wizard mode: completing all three Trainings once; collecting a Jackpot Deluxe; playing all three of Multi-Brawl, Fisticuffs Multiball, and Raid Multiball; defeating 1 boxer by Knockout; and defeating 5 boxers overall. If you have done all of these things AND you have not yet played Ultimate Challenge, the next fight you start will be the Ultimate Challenge.</p>

<p>In Ultimate Challenge, your goal is to defeat the 5 boxers that you <i>haven't</i> faced yet, one after the other on a single life bar. I belive the fight purses in Ultimate Challenge are 2,500,000, then 5,000,000, then 7,500,000, then 10,000,000, then 12,500,000. Ultimate Challenge starts as a 4-ball multiball. Just bash the boxer as much as you can, using whatever Smart Punches you have. You can continue Ultimate Challenge even if there is only 1 ball in play as long as you still have life in your health bar. If you run out of health, the game returns to normal play (if there is 1 ball left) or Fisticuffs Multiball rules (if there are 2+ balls left). If you do defeat all the boxers in time, Victory Laps begin: all major shots are lit for 5,000,000 points. Making a shot unlights it, except for the left Balcony ramp, which scores 5,000,000 points per shot for the rest of the ball.</p>

<p>A significant bug exists in many versions of the game code for Champion Pub. If Ultimate Challenge phase 1 ends via any method other than running out of health with exactly 1 ball in play, the game will enter an invalid state where no Fights or Multiballs can ever be started except for Fisticuffs Multiball. This invalid state affects all players in all games until the entire machine is turned off and back on. This bug was mostly fixed in code version 1.6 (the final and most common version), but can still sometimes be triggered by defeating one of the Ultimate Challenge boxers with a Knockout punch. This bug, combined with the imbalanced rules for skill shots when there are 2 balls in the physical lock, are why Champion Pub is almost always played as single-player-only games in a competition setting instead of a standard 4-player game.</p>

<h4>Cash Fights</h4>
<p>If you have won the first 5 fights and you have either 1) already played Ultimate Challenge, or 2) not completed all the requirements for Ultimate Challenge, any fight that you start will be a Cash Fight. You need to bet points to pick a boxer to fight. The boxers with higher bets aren't actually harder, so the choice just comes down to how much you are willing to risk.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>If your score is less than 200,000,000 points:</b> the game considers your "adjusted score" to be your current score rounded down to a multiple of 10,000,000. The five bet options will be for 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of your adjusted score. I don't know what happens if you start a Cash Fight with less than 10,000,000 points in your score.</li>
	<li><b>If your score is at least 200,000,000 points:</b> the five bet options will always be 40,000,000, 80,000,000, 120,000,000, 160,000,000, and 200,000,000 points. (Supposedly on some old versions of the game code, these options were 80,000,000, 160,000,000, 240,000,000, 64,000,000, and 144,000,000 instead.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The default Purse value of a Cash Fight is always 2,500,000. If you win a Cash Fight, you receive the Purse value as well as the amount of your bet. If you lose a Cash Fight by any means, the value of your bet is deducted from your score. It is not possible to collect a score-based extra ball or free game multiple times by using Cash Fight to repeatedly go above and below the threshold. In Cash Fights, you can still defeat boxers by Knockout and go on to play Ultimate Challenge if you have not already. Late-game Champion Pub just comes down to who can win the most 200,000,000 point Cash Fights.</p>

<h3>Fisticuffs Multiball</h3>

<p>At basically any point in the game where there is not a Fight in progress, shooting the punching bag toy awards a letter in the phrase Bar Fly Fisticuffs. Spelling the entire phrase with 16 shots starts Fisticuffs Multiball, a 2-ball multiball where the punching bag rotates to reveal the boxer, and any stomach shots score 100,000 points and any head shots score 500,000 points. Not much value here, but it can add up if stacked with Multi-Brawl or Raid Multiball, and it's required to play Fisticuffs once to get the Multiballs Complete jewel on the champion's belt (playing Champion Multiball, which includes Fisticuffs Multiball's rules, does not count).</p>

<p>If at any point you hit the punching bag toy to receive a letter in Bar Fly Fisticuffs and you hear an insect buzzing, quickly hit the launch button to score 100,000 points and a Smart Punch thanks to a Bar Fly, Cow Fly, or Bob Fly award. </p>

<h3>Shadow Boxing</h3>

<p>If an orbit shot is not lit for anything at all- no Jackpot, no Training, no Lock, no Contender's Challenge or Victory Lap- that shot's u-turn ramp will come down, putting the ball back into the nearest in lane instead of going around the table. Making 3 u-turn ramps in single-ball, non-Fight play starts the Shadow Boxing hurry-up round. Shadow Boxing is a hurry-up that starts at 200,000 points (plus an additional 200,000 for each time a Shadow Boxing award has been collected) and counts down rather slowly; collect the hurry-up at the punching bag toy. Shoot either Jab u-turn tamp to add 200,000 points to the hurry-up's value, with no limit that I've ever seen. The first 4 Shadow Boxing rounds each require 3 u-turn ramps to start; completing them awards a Smart Punch the first time, Light Poker Night the second time, Light Second Wind the third time, and Light Extra Ball the fourth time. After every 4 Shadow Boxing wins, the lists of awards resets, and the number of u-turn ramps required to start each Shadow Boxing mode increases by 3.</p>

<h3>Spittin' Gallery video mode</h3>

<p>Spittin' Gallery is a video mode that is lit at the lower left scoop as a Door Prize from a skill shot, or by winning 1 fight. Six people are lined up at a bar in the distance, and you control a spittoon in front of them, moving it left or right with the flippers. Catch the spit they launch at you in the spittoon. You'll get credit for a made shot if the spitball touches any part of the spittoon's rim, but not necessarily the body of the jar. Your goal is to catch 10 spitballs before missing 3. Your award is 2,500,000 points just for playing the mode, 250,000 per caught spitball, 2,500,000 for winning, and 2,500,000 for a perfect victory, for a maximum of 10,000,000 points. Occasionally, the bargoers can spit an extra ball at you instead of a spitball; catching it scores an instant extra ball, missing it does not count against you.</p>

<h3>Poker Night video mode</h3>

<p>Poker Night is a video mode that is lit at the lower left scoop as a Door Prize from a skill shot, or by winning Shadow Boxing for a 2nd, 6th, 10th...etc., time. Poker Night is simply a single hand of straight poker. You are dealt 5 cards. Use the left or right flippers to move between cards; press the launch button to designate a card as a discard; press both flippers to lock in your choice for the hand. Any cards that you chose to discard will be replaced by other playing cards to form a new 5-card hand, and you get an award based on the best poker combination that can be made with your new hand.</p>
<ul>
	<li>High Card: 250,000 points</li>
	<li>Pair: the current Purse is doubled</li>
	<li>Two Pair: +5 bonus multiplier</li>
	<li>Three of a Kind: Lights all three jackpots</li>
	<li>Straight (5 cards of consecutive values): Start Fight is lit</li>
	<li>Flush (5 cards of one suit): Shadow Boxing starts automatically</li>
	<li>Full House (three of a kind and a pair): Multi-Brawl begins instantly</li>
	<li>Four of a Kind: Lights extra ball</li>
	<li>Straight Flush (5 consecutive value cards of the same suit): the current Purse is instantly maxed out at 60,000,000 points</li>
	<li>Royal Flush (Ace-King-Queen-Jack-10 of a single suit): you are instantly awarded one of the jewels on the champion's belt toward wizard mode, or 500,000 points if you already have all 5</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Champion Pub has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes are lit alternately for Lite Jackpot based on slingshot hits. Out lanes can be lit alternately for Second Wind, which acts as +3 boxing health and a ball saver, by collecting Second Wind from a Door Prize skill shot or Shadow Boxing.</p>

<p>The right out lane area is Against the Ropes. There are quite a lot of miscellaneous posts in this area; the ball can end up over here by sneaking around the Beer targets above or below. Nudge the ball however you can so that it doesn't end up in the out lane; the ball can even return to the shooter lane, where it will be automatically plunged again. There's no penalty for doing any of this; if you end up in the shooter lane when Start Fight is lit, the game will start the next fight for you on the autoplunge.</p>

<p>There is a center post between the flippers that temporarily completely blocks off the center drain. It is raise for a few seconds at the start of each player's turn, each fight, and each multiball. There is generally no compensation for a ball that drains down the center when the post is supposed to be raised (due to a malfunction or poor flipper skills) unless the center post mechanism is disabled entirely.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is calculated as 10,000 for each full life point you currently have, plus 50,000 points per fight started over the course of the game, plus 100,000 points per fight won over the game, plus 250,000 points per fight won by knockout in the game so far, all multiplied by the bonus multiplier. Bonus multiplier is raised by 1 by hitting the yellow post targets near the Hook ramps a total of 3 times, or the multiplier can be raised by 5 from a skill shot or Poker Night award. Max bonus multiplier is 25x. Bonus multiplier is never held from ball to ball. End of ball bonus is usually worth several million points, and is worth keeping track of early in a game, but if you get to the point where you are able to play a lot of Cash Fights, bonus will quickly lose its relative value.</p>
