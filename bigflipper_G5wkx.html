<h1>Cowboy / Big Flipper (Chicago Coin, 1970)</h1>

<p>Cowboy is the 4-player version. Big Flipper is the 2-player version, with identical rules and scoring but very different artwork.</p>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Advance the bonus repeatedly by shooting the standup targets in the middle left and right or shooting the orbits to get back to the top lanes. Advancing the bonus past its maximum value resets the bonus to 100 points and scores an instant 1,000 points. Bonus value is preserved across balls, players, and games. Bonus value is also collected at the center saucer and far out lanes. Spelling A-B-C from the top lanes or orbits awards an instant extra ball.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>The Flippers</h3>

<p>Cowboy and Big Flipper use Jumbo Flippers, which are 5 inches long instead of the usual 3. These flippers have a much smaller range of motion and move from lowered to raised much more slowly than conventional flippers. In their raised position, jumbo flippers are still angled below the horizontal, making any kind of catch impossible (though with good timing, you can still stop the ball's motion with a live catch or drop catch, as long as you are ready to flip away again almost immediately). Also, dead bounces are not advised. Most meaningful shots need to be taken when the ball is closer to the tip of the flipper rather than the hinge.</p>

<h3>Advancing Bonus</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by any top lane or the standup targets on the left and right sides of the playfield. Bonus is advanced in the sequence 100-200-300-400-500-1,000, though the operator may set the game so 500 is the max bonus instead. The bonus is awarded when the ball lands in the center saucer between the two mini-bumpers, or when the ball drains down either far out lane. If the bonus is at its maximum value (500 or 1,000) and gets advanced again, the bonus value will be reset to 100, but you will score an instant 1,000 points. The bonus value is preserved from ball to ball, player to player, and game to game, which makes Big Flipper a poor multiplayer game- you may be able to walk up to the game, plunge the ball once, score 1,100 points, and have that be the difference in a competitive game.</p>

<p>Shooting for the center saucer to score the bonus value is not advised due to the mini-bumpers on either side of the saucer. Always focus on advancing the bonus and trying to earn the 1,000 for "overfilling" the bonus value.</p>

<h3>A-B-C letters and bumpers</h3>

<p>Top lanes score 100 points and advance the bonus; they also light the letters A-B-C, from left to right. Make an unlit lane to light it. The A can also be collected from the left orbit and the near right out lane, and the C can also be collected from the right orbit and near left out lane. B can only be earned at the center top lane. Lighting all of A-B-C in one ball scores an instant extra ball.</p>

<p>The two upper pop bumpers always score 10 points. The lower, mini pop bumpers score 1 point or 10 when lit. Making the left orbit lights the right mini bumper, and making the right orbit lights the left mini bumper.</p>

<h3>Ball Saver center post</h3>

<p>The Ball Saver center post completely blocks off the flipper gap when it is raised. Due to the lower range of motion of the jumbo flippers, it is (likely) impossible to drain the ball under a raised flipper when the post is up. The post is raised by the rollover button just above the flipper gap and lowered by the rollover buttons near the slingshots. On some copies of Cowboy/Big Flipper, when the ball is at rest on one flipper and the Ball Saver post, using that flipper will always hit the Advance Bonus standup target on the opposite side, which can be very helpful; however, be mindful that the Ball Saver Down rollover button is along the path to the side standup targets, meaning this is not always a repeatable strategy.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes. There are 2 out lanes on each side. Slingshots are located above the out lanes. Near out lanes score 100 points or 300 when lit; one lane is lit at a time, alternating based on 10-point switches hit throughout the game. The left and right near out lanes also light A and C respectively. The far left and far right out lanes score the current Bonus score, or Special when lit; Special is lit very rarely, seemingly based on 10- and 100-point switch hits, and is lit on both out lanes at once when it is qualified. The bonus score is not awarded at the end of your ball if you drain down the center.</p>

<p>Tilt ends the ball in play only. Maximum 1 extra ball per ball in play. Special can be set to award extra ball, but there does not seem to be an option to make it worth points.</p>
