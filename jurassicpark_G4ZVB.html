<h1>Jurassic Park (Data East, 1993)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with The Lost World: Jurassic Park (Sega, 1997) or any of the various Jurassic Park games released by Stern Pinball between 2019 and 2023.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Jurassic Park is a relatively standard mode-based early 90s pinball game. System Failure wizard mode is one of the most accessible wizard modes in pinball thanks to the repeatability of a right ramp -> control room scoop combo, which starts a mode each time. Beelining to System Failure can net you 300-400 million points, which is good, but very skilled players should opt for Tri-Ball and Chaos Multiball; complete the lower left and center dinosaur targets, then shoot T-Rex, then in multiball collect the right ramp and upper loop jackpots followed by spelling Chaos.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>The skill shot is a timed pull of the gun trigger plunger. Pull the trigger when the crosshairs on the display are aimed at the walking dinosaur to successfully score the skill shot. A successful skill shot scores 2,000,000 points on ball 1, 3,000,000 on ball 2, and 4,000,000 on ball 3, and any successful skill shot also starts Super Pops, in which all bumpers score 100,000 points and hitting all 3 bumpers scores a 1,000,000 point bonus until the ball leaves the bumper area. A failed skill shot scores 1/10 as many points as a successful one and does not start Super Pops, though the ball is plunged into the bumper area in any case.</p>

<h3>Smart Missile</h3>

<p>The large red button on top of the gun launcher is the Smart Missile button. The Smart Missile can be used once per game and generally collects one shot for free toward any mode or feature running at that time. The Smart Missile is best used during Tri-Ball multiball; specific Smart Missile awards are discussed alongside their associated features throughout this guide. Triggering an out lane switch temporarily deactivates the Smart Missile; it is reactivated at the start of the next ball, or when another switch on the playfield is activated following a death save or bang back.</p>

<h3>Control Room modes, including System Failure wizard mode</h3>

<p>Modes are started by shooting the Control Room saucer, labelled with the letter A and positioned in roughly the same place as the Electric Chair on Addams Family, when it is lit. Shooting the Power Shed scoop in the upper right lights the Control Room solidly, and it will stay lit until collected. If System Failure wizard mode has not yet been played, the Control Room can also be lit temporarily (about 5 seconds) by rolling through either in lane. For the first set of Control Room modes, you can easily relight and start modes by shooting the right ramp, immediately followed by a very early left flipper shot that backhands the ball into the Control Room.<br>New modes can be started while any other mode is running, but you cannot start a mode during any multiball. In fact, starting any multiball instantly ends all Control Room modes currently in progress. Using the Smart Missile during any single-ball play will instantly start a Control Room mode as long as neither Two-Ball nor Tri-Ball are currently ready. If the Control Room is currently unlit or flashing, hitting any pop bumper will change which mode is lit, but if the Control Room is solidly lit, the currently selected mode is locked in as the next mode to start. The modes are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Stampede:</b> a 20-second frenzy round. The frenzy value starts at 300,000 points. Hitting any switch in the game scores the current frenzy value and adds 10,000 points to the next switch's value, with no limit that I've ever encountered. Using the Smart Missile during Stampede seems to score the next 20-ish switch values and immediately ends the round. Since the Control Room is always solidly lit at the start of each ball and immediately after playing System Failure, Stampede is always the first mode to be played.</li>
	<li><b>Escape Isla Nublar:</b> shoot the left orbit through the bumpers, the upper loop, and the upper right boat dock saucer in any order. The mode value starts at 20,000,000 and decreases by 1,000,000 every 2 seconds. Making one of the three listed shots scores the current value and adds 10,000,000 to the countdown. The mode ends when the value has ticked down a total of 10 times. This is generally the most valuable mode, being worth about 80,000,000 points when done well. Using the Smart Missile during this mode immediately gives credit for all remaining shots and ends the mode; if you use the Missile before making any of the three indicated shots, you score 3x the current mode value, plus 30,000,000 points.</li>
	<li><b>Bone Busting:</b> shoot the right ramp three times in 20 seconds. If you succeed, you are awarded 20,000,000 points. I believe that if you make just 1 or 2 ramps, you get 5,000,000 or 10,000,000 instead respectively. Using the Smart Missile instantly ends the mode as a completion, awarding the 20,000,000. This is worth skipping.</li>
	<li><b>Feed T-Rex:</b> you have 30 seconds to shoot the popper in front of T-Rex one time for 30,000,000 points. This value does not decrease over time, and only 1 shot is needed. Using the Smart Missile spots the shot for you.</li>
	<li><b>Mosquito:</b> shoot the captive ball as many times as you can in 20 seconds. The first shot scores 5,000,000 points and subsequent shots score 1,000,000 each time with no limit that I've ever encountered. Using the Smart Missile spots the next captive ball shot (just one) but does not end the mode. This is also worth skipping.</li>
	<li><b>Lite Extra Ball:</b> self explanatory. The lit extra ball is at the far right Boat Dock shot. Using the Smart Missile with the extra ball lit does collect it.</li>
	<li><b>Raptor Rampage:</b> a velociraptor walks back and forth across the DMD display. Shooting the Raptor Pit kicker in the top center of the table will cause the raptor to eat the number he is closest to, collecting that many millions of points. On Data East's original software, the numbers are 5-6-7-8-9-10-9-8-7-6-5, but I believe that on fanmade updated code from the mid-2010s, the numbers are 5-7-9-11-13-15-13-11-9-7-5. Using the Smart Missile scores what one shot to the Raptor Pit would be worth, but does not display the animation for such, so it's not super clear that that is what happened; the round does not end after using the Smart Missile.</li>
	<li><b>System Boot:</b> a scoop-shooting mode similar to Addams Family's Tunnel Hunt. In 20 seconds, shoot the Bunker and Control Room scoops in the lower left and the Power Shed in the upper right in any order. The first scoop scores 5,000,000, the second scores 10,000,000, and the third scores 15,000,000, for a maximum of 30,000,000. Using the Smart Missile scores all three scoop values, giving you the full 30,000,000 points and ending the mode.</li>
	<li><b>2-Ball:</b> qualifies Raptor Two-Ball, a quick multiball that is started by shooting the Boat Dock in the upper right. Using the Smart Missile when Two-Ball is lit will instantly start Two-Ball. Starting Two-Ball by any means will instantly end all other modes currently in progress. During Two-Ball, the Raptor Pit scores an increasing jackpot worth 7,000,000 points the first time, increasing by 2,000,000 each subsequent time it is scored, with no limit that I have ever encountered. Using the Smart Missile during Two-Ball scores one Raptor Jackpot, and is probably the most wasteful use of a Smart Missile you can possibly have.</li>
	<li><b>Spitter Attack:</b> hit any of the three standup targets a total of 3 times in 20 seconds to score 5,000,000, then 10,000,000, then 15,000,000 points. The Smart Missile instantly spots all three shots, scoring the full 30,000,000 and ending the mode.</li>
	<li><b>Electric Fence:</b> hit 20 pop bumpers in 30 seconds to score 30,000,000 points and end the mode. The Smart Missile instantly scores the 30,000,000 points and ends the mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once all 11 modes have been played, the Control Room scoop is automatically lit for System Failure, the game's wizard mode. When System Failure starts, the DMD and playfield lights go crazy as if something is actually malfunctioning, and then 6 balls are plunged to the playfield. In System Failure, you get unlimited ball save for 45 seconds, and every switch in the game scores 1,000,000 points- that's it, no other rules. Since System Failure is a mode, it cannot be started while another multiball is running, but since System Failure is also a multiball, starting System Failure will instantly end any other mode that was already in progress. The best place to be during System Failure is to have as many balls in the pop bumpers as possible at all times, which may mean intentionally letting balls drain so their autoplunged replacements are fired into the bumpers. Using the Smart Missile scores an instant 50,000,000 points. A good System Failure that does not use the Smart Missile will usually score between 100,000,000 and 120,000,000 points. Once the 45 seconds expires, all balls are allowed to drain, and the same player continues shooting, with all Control Room mode progress reset so that the modes can be played again. Once System Failure has been played once, the in lanes no longer temporarily light the Control Room scoop for a mode start, and you need to shoot the Power Shed scoop in the upper right to qualify a mode, which makes getting to a second System Failure quite a bit harder.</p>

<h3>Tri-Ball standard multiball</h3>

<p>Hit the 6 dinosaur standup targets- 3 in the lower left, and 3 in the center of the table facing right- to qualify Tri-Ball, which is the game's standard multiball. Making a left in lane -> far right Boat Dock shot combo spots 1 dinosaur target. If Tri-Ball has not yet been played, you also get 3 dinosaur targets spotted for you at the beginning of balls 2 and 3, which guarantees that Tri-Ball will be ready at least once in every game. Once Tri-Ball is ready, there are two ways to start it: you can either "taunt the raptors" by shooting the Raptor Pit kicker a lot (3 times for the first multiball, +2 for each subsequent multiball) or you can make a single shot that feeds the T-Rex. Feeding T-Rex is absolutely the way to go, because it's a less dangerous shot and never gets harder. When Tri-Ball starts, a total of 3 balls are put on the playfield, and all in-progress modes are immediately ended. Tri-Ball progression works like this:</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Dual Jackpots.</b> There is a ball save at the start of this step. The right ramp is lit for a jackpot that starts at 15,000,000 points, and the upper loop is lit for a jackpot that starts at 30,000,000 points. Hitting any switch in the game adds the value of that switch to both jackpots. Collecting a jackpot unlights it. The Smart Missile will only collect the upper loop's jackpot for you; you still need to get the right ramp jackpot on your own.</li>
	<li></b>Spell Chaos.</b> After collecting either one of the two Dual Jackpots, the letters in Chaos start to flash. Chaos letters are collected at the two lower left scoops, the left orbit switch just past the pop bumpers, the right ramp, and the upper right scoop. Collecting a Chaos letter scores 5,000,000 points. Completing Chaos scores an additional 10,000,000 points and upgrades the Tri-Ball into Six-Ball. Using the Smart Missile at this point instantly spells Chaos and starts Six-Ball; now would be a great time to use the Smart Missile if you still have it.</li>
	<li><b>Six-Ball.</b> There is a ball save at the start of this step. Balls are plunged to the playfield until there are a total of 6 balls in play. Spell Chaos again, this time scoring 10,000,000 points per letter. Using the Smart Missile here finishes the word Chaos, scoring 50,000,000 points. From now on, do whatever it takes to keep as many balls in play as possible (except for tilting, of course).</li>
	<li><b>Feed T-Rex.</b> After spelling Chaos a second time, the only thing to do is shoot the saucer in front of the T-Rex for 50,000,000 points. The Smart Missile can do this for you if you still have it.</li>
	<li><b>Super Jackpots.</b> The right ramp and upper loop are now lit for Dual Super Jackpots. The ramp is worth 100,000,000 points times the number of balls in play, for a maximum of 600,000,000; the upper loop is worth 15,000,000 more than the right ramp, for a maximum of 615,000,000 points. Collecting a jackpot unlights it. Collecting both Super Jackpots sends you back to the beginning of stage 3, with no new ball saver and no more balls added to the playfield; work your way back to the super jackpot as many times as you can before single ball play resumes. If you somehow held on to your Smart Missile all the way to now, it will collect both Super Jackpots at once, which can be worth over 1,000,000,000 points; you should absolutely use your smart missile as soon as you recognize that super jackpots are lit.</li>
</ol>

<p>If multiball ends during stage 1 before either of the standard dual jackpots are collected, a Tri-Ball Restart is available at the Raptor Pit or Feed T-Rex for 15 seconds. Using the restart means you only get 2 balls instead of 3, but if you progress to stage 3 of multiball from the restart, you will still get all 6 balls. The Smart Missile can be used to trigger the Restart, but it really shouldn't be used that way. There is no ball save of any kind on the Tri-Ball restart.</p>

<h3>Victory Laps</h3>

<p>When you reach the game's replay score, Victory Laps automatically begins. Victory Laps is a 30 second mode where the goal is to shoot the right ramp 6 times: the first 5 score 5,000,000 each, and the 6th scores 25,000,000, for a total of 50,000,000 points. Victory Laps starts immediately; if any Control Room modes were running, those modes are <i>paused</i> until Victory Laps ends, and resume automatically afterward. Victory Laps can even be running during Two-Ball, any level of Tri-Ball, or System Failure. The Smart Missile does NOT collect any Victory Laps for you.</p>

<h3>Mr. DNA mystery award</h3>

<p>Shooting the right ramp enough times lights the Bunker scoop in the far lower left for a Mr. DNA mystery award. The first award needs 3 ramp shots, and each subsequent award needs 2 more than the previous, up to a maximum of at least 9. When you shoot the Bunker scoop, Mr. DNA will automatically scroll through a list of three awards; press the flippers or the gun trigger to select an award. Awards include the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Points: 5, 10, 15, or 20 million</li>
	<li>Super Pops: on the next trip to the bumpers, all bumpers score 100,000 points and hitting all three bumpers awards 1,000,000 points per set, until the ball leaves the bumpers</li>
	<li>Complete Egg</li>
	<li>Light Special: on the out lanes</li>
	<li>Hurry-up Extra Ball, Score, or 2-Ball: all available for about 10 seconds and collectible at the far right Boat Dock shot. The Score option starts at 20,000,000 and counts down to 5,000,000.</li>
	<li>Tri-Ball Ready</li>
	<li>Bonus Hold or Raptor Hold</li>
	<li>...others?</li>
</ul>
<p>In competition settings, the order of offered Mr. DNA awards is set. The first set is always 5,000,000/Complete Egg/Hurry-up Score; I don't know the rest of the order.</p>

<h3>Raptor Pit</h3>

<p>Shooting the kicker lane between the captive ball and the right ramp awards a Raptor Pit. The Raptor Pit value starts each ball at 2,000,000 points, and increases by 350,000 each time the Raptor Pit is scored. The Raptor Pit value can be held to the next ball by shooting the upper loop two consecutive times. When the Raptor Pit ejects the ball, it comes back down the table with incredibly high speed, and the "Danger" light in front of the Raptor Pit will flash. While this light is flashing, ball save is active. Hitting the Raptor Pit again while the Danger light is flashing will recollect all Raptor Pit values scored since the Danger light was completely off. For example, hit the Raptor Pit once for 2,000,000; hit it again immediately for 2,000,000 + 2,350,000 = 4,350,000; hit it again immediately for 4,350,000 + 2,700,000 = 7,050,000; etc.</p>

<h3>Captive ball: hatching eggs and Super Egg Mania</h3>

<p>Hit the captive ball repeatedly to hatch dinosaurs and earn awards. The first 3 hatches require 3, 4, and 5 hits respectively; every hatch after that needs 6 hits. The hatch awards are 5,000,000, then 10,000,000, then 15,000,000, then light extra ball, then 20,000,000. The 2nd hatch may also light an extra ball in accordance with game settings and extra ball percentaging. Starting with the 4th hatch, every hatch starts Super Egg Mania. Starting with the 6th hatch, every hatch scores a mystery award (either 20,000,000 points, light extra ball, or light special).</p>

<p>Super Egg Mania is started by hatching 4+ eggs or as a mystery award from Mr. DNA. A 25-second timer starts. Every hit to the captive ball scores 5,000,000 points and adds a ball to the playfield, unless all 6 are already in play. Captive ball hits no longer add balls if the timer has run out. The mode continues until there is both no time left on the clock and only one ball in play. All Control Room modes in progress are immediately ended when Super Egg Mania begins, and you cannot start any new modes or multiballs until Super Egg Mania ends. Using a Smart Missile during Super Egg Mania scores 5,000,000 points, adds 1 ball to the playfield if the 25 second timer is still running, and is a massive waste of a Smart Missile.</p>

<h3>Shootout</h3>

<p>At random times, a video mode will begin, indicated by a distinctive noise. Pull the gun trigger about 5 times within a few seconds to stun a dinosaur, score 3,000,000 points, and activate Super Pops.</p>

<h3>T-Rex Bounty</h3>

<p>When the T-Rex is not lit for anything else, shooting the saucer in front of the T-Rex awards a letter in T-Rex, as indicated on the game apron near the left flipper. Spell T-Rex to earn the T-Rex Bounty, a minor progressive jackpot that seems to start at around 8,000,000 points, increase by about 250,000 points per right ramp shot, reset when collected, and build up across players and games.</p>

<h3>Park Revenue</h3>

<p>Park Revenue starts at 500,000 points and increases by 30,000 with each pop bumper hit. Collect the Park Revenue value by shooting the lower left Bunker scoop immediately after rolling through the right in lane.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Jurassic Park has a conventional in/out lane setup. The left in lane lights the Boat Dock to spot a dinosaur target toward Tri-Ball. The right in lane lights the Bunker scoop to score Park Revenue and lights the left orbit shot through the bumpers to advance the bonus multiplier. Both in lanes temporarily light the Control Room scoop to start a mode, but only if the current player has not played System Failure in this game already. Out lanes deactivate the Smart Missile and can be lit for Special by random Egg Hatch and Mr. DNA mystery awards.</p>

<p>Jurassic Park does recognize bang backs and death saves. If the ball goes down an out lane but then a switch in the game other than a slingshot is triggered, you will receive a 5,000,000 point Death Save bonus, the Smart Missile is reactivated, and your turn continues. This is a very illegal move in any competition play, and performing it incorrectly can damage the machine or injure the player.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is simply calculated based on a count of switch hits. I do not know the exact formula. Max base bonus is 2,000,000 points, which is piddling score. A right in lane -> left orbit combo advances the bonus multiplier in the sequence 3x-6x-9x. Making two consecutive shots to the right ramp without missing will hold over the end of ball bonus and multiplier on the current ball to the next one. All in all, end of ball bonus on Jurassic Park, is basically worthless.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>Bowen Kerins' notes guide indicates that in tournament mode, extra balls score 25,000,000 points. This seems reasonable, but I have not confirmed it for myself, nor am I aware of a point value that can be assigned to specials for competition/novelty play.</p>

<p>The ball save that is activated following a Raptor Pit shot can be disabled. This seems like an especially mean-spirited thing to do. The Danger light will still flash and the increased scoring is still available, but you won't get the ball back if the Raptors throw it down the center drain, which is liable to happen a fair amount.</p>

<p>T-Rex letters can either be reset at the beginning of each ball, or carried from ball to ball for each individual player during a game. If the latter setting is chosen, don't expect T-Rex Bounty to ever be worth much more than 10,000,000 points.</p>
