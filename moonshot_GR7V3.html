<h1>Moon Shot / Astronaut (Chicago Coin, 1969)</h1>

<p>Moon Shot is the 4-player version. Astronaut is the 2-player version. The two versions have identical rules and scoring.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Plunge between the top passive bumpers to get the ball stuck in the pop bumper nest. Passive bumpers and pop bumpers rotate the value fo the Moon and Venus lanes in the center of the playfield up to a maximum of 500 points. If the Moon and Venus values are equal, the corresponding standup target is lit; lit standup targets score 300 points and open an out lane gate. Shoot the curved center lanes or lit standup targets whenever possible. Be mindful that any ball coming down the playfield along the outer sides has a very high risk of center drain.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Changing and Scoring the Moon and Venus values</h3>

<p>The left passive bumper, upper left pop bumper, lower right pop bumper, and left rollover button change the Moon Value, The right passive bumper, upper right pop bumper, lower left pop bumper, and right rollover button change the Venus Value. Each time these values are changed, they increase in the sequence 50 - 100 - 200 - 300 - 500; increasing the value past 500 resets it to 50. The Moon Value can be collected at the left curved lane in the center of the playfield, and the Venus value can be collected at the right curved lane. The curvature of the center lanes makes it much easier to get a ball through them with a backhand shot, e.g., shooting the Venus lane with the right flipper. The Moon and Venus values can also be collected at the left and right out lanes, respectively.</p>

<h3>Line-up feature: how to light things</h3>

<p>If the Moon and Venus values are equal, additional features on the table are lit.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Both values are 50 points (orange): lower right standup target is lit</li>
	<li>Both values are 100 points (blue): upper right standup target, upper left pop bumper, and lower right pop bumper are lit</li>
	<li>Both values are 200 points (white): upper left standup target is lit</li>
	<li>Both values are 300 points (yellow): lower left standup target, upper right pop bumper, and lower left pop bumper are lit</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a bumper or standup target is lit, it stays lit for the rest of the ball. Pop bumpers score 1 point, or 10 points when lit. The center red pop bumper is always lit. Standup targets score 100 points when not lit; if they are lit, they score 300 points and open the out lane gate on their side of the playfield (left/right).</p>

<p>It would make logical sense for the out lanes to be lit red for a Special whenever the Moon and Venus values are aligned at 500 points; however, this is not the case. Specials seem to be lit intermittently based on 1-point switch hits on certain balls of the game, regardless of what the current Moon and Venus values are. Similarly, the center rollover button is lit for Extra Ball occasionally based on 1-point switch hits. I have not determined the exact methods by which the Special or Extra Ball are lit. Special and Extra Ball cannot be assigned a point value for competition/novelty play.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>The outer sides of the table have only a single rather large lane. The switches in these lanes score the Moon Value (left out lane) or Venus Value (right out lane). Hitting either left standup target when lit opens the left out lane gate; this takes the form of a large metal flipper-shaped object that redirects the ball to the left in lane. A switch in the left in lane closes the left out lane gate once it is used. A one-way metal gate is placed immediately behind the flipper hinge so that a ball cannot roll up the flipper, trigger the in lane switch, and close the left out lane gate without the gate being properly used. This entire mechanism also exists on the right side, where the gate is opened by lit right standup targets.</p>

<p>The center drain gap between the flippers is very wide. Any ball coming down the table, especially if it leaves the pop bumper area down the sides instead of via a curved center lane, has a very high risk of center drain; try to nudge the ball off the side walls where possible to give it enough horizontal momentum to reach a flipper. Some copies of Astronaut/Moon Shot have a center post between the flippers, though I do not believe this was part of the game's original design.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus. Tilt ends the current ball in play only. Do not be afraid to make large movements to save a ball if necessary.</p>
