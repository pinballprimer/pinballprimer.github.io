<h1>Liberty Belle (Gottlieb, 1962)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Liberty Bell (Williams, 1977).</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Use the upper flippers to keep the ball in the upper half of the playfield as long as possible. If the ball makes it to the lower flippers and you haven't lit all three pop bumpers yet, hit the center standup targets to light them before going back up. It's very hard to hit lit roto-targets on purpose, so the most consistent scoring comes from getting the ball to rattle around lit pop bumpers.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Score 5 points, or 50 when lit. One top lane is always lit, alternating each time a 1-point switch is scored. The left top lane spins the left roto-target, and the right top lane spins the right roto-target.</p>

<h3>Roto-targets</h3>

<p>There are two roto-targets; one in the top left, and one in the top right. Two panels of each are visible at any given time. Roto-target panels can read 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50. Hitting a roto-target panel scores the visible number. One of the 4 visible panels across the two roto-targets is lit at any given time; which one is lit rotates every time a 1-point switch is scored. Hitting a lit roto-target scores 10x the displayed value, for a maximum of 500 points. While lucrative, this is inconsistent enough that it should not be considered as a primary strategy. Roto-targets are spun by making the corresponding top lane or by hitting either of the two 5-point passive bumpers labelled SPIN on the sides of the table.</p>

<h3>Pop bumpers</h3>

<p>The three pop bumpers score 1 point, or 10 when lit. At first, only one pop bumper is lit at a time, and which one is lit rotates each time a 1-point switch is scored. To light all three bumpers at once, shoot the center standup target, which also alternates between 5 or 50 points based on 1-point switch hits. When all three bumpers are lit, the only way to turn them off and go back to the state where 1 bumper is lit is by draining down an out lane. If you drain down the center with all 3 bumpers lit, they will stay lit for your next ball/for the next player's turn.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes. 2-inch mini flippers back up directly to the slingshots. When only 1 bumper is lit, slingshots always score 1 point; when all 3 bumpers are lit, one slingshot will be lit for 10 points, and which slingshot is lit alternates with 1-point switch hits. Out lanes score 10 points or 100 when lit; again, one of these is lit at a time, alternating based on 1-point switch hits.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus, extra ball feature, or playfield Special. I believe tilt ends game, but only for the player who tilted.</p>
