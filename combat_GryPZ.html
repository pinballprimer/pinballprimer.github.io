<h1>Combat (Zaccaria, 1977)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>From the left flipper, shoot the Bombs drop targets in the upper right. From the right flipper, shoot the spinner if the left saucer value is not maxed out, otherwise shoot the left saucer itself for 50,000 points. In either case, try to nudge so that the pop bumpers send the ball into the upper right kicker lane at least once per ball to qualify the 10x bonus.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top rollover buttons</h3>

<p>Buttons score 10 points when not lit, or 5,000 points plus a bonus advance when lit. There are seven buttons lit in two groups: group 1 is the leftmost and rightmost buttons on the top row and the middle button of the bottom row, and group 2 is the other four. Hitting a pop bumper changes which group of buttons is lit.</p>

<h3>Upper right kicker lane</h3>

<p>Cannot be shot directly, but is a reasonably frequent destination for balls leaving the pop bumper area. This channel scores 5,000 points, awards 10x bonus multiplier, and causes the spinner to light and the bumpers to flash for 15 seconds; during these 15 seconds, bumpers and spins each score 1,000 points instead of 100.</p>

<h3>Spinner and left saucer</h3>

<p>The spinner scores 100 points per spin when not lit, or 1,000 per spin when lit. It is lit for 15 seconds after the left saucer or the upper right kicker lane is scored.</p>

<p>The left saucer value starts at 50 points. This value increases to 500 points after 3 hole advances, 5,000 points after 6 hole advances, and 50,000 points after 9 hole advances. To earn one hole advance, you must do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Register 5 or 10 spins of the spinner, depending on game settings</li>
	<li>Hit the lower of the two yellow standup targets on the right</li>
	<li>Roll through either in lane</li>
</ul>
<p>Making the left saucer scores the currently lit value, lights the spinner and flashes the pop bumpers for 15 seconds, and does <i>not</i> reset the hole value. This means that once it is fully advanced to 50,000 points, the left saucer is the only thing you should shoot for. Maxing out the saucer value at 50,000 points also lights the out lanes alternately for Bonus Ball; this is a conventional extra ball, and which out lane is lit alternates each time a bumper is made.</p>

<h3>Bombs targets</h3>

<p>Each drop target down in the Bombs 5-bank scores 1,000 points. Completing the bank resets the bank and lights the red center standup target for a Special. Hitting the target when lit for Special unlights it; you may not want to do this, because as long as the Special remains lit, further drop targets knocked down in the Bombs bank score 10,000 points each instead of 1,000. Special can be set to a free game or an extra ball; I am pretty sure it cannot be set to score points.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Combat has a nearly conventional in/out lane setup. However, part of the rail separating the in and out lanes is cut off. A ball rolling up a flipper quickly can roll through this gap and fall out, but a ball going down and out lane can be nudged off a small pin in the out lane and knocked back into play. In lanes score 1,000 points and one hole advance. Out lanes score 10,000 points, as well as an extra ball when lit; extra ball is lit alternately between the two out lanes (swapping based on bumper hits) when the hole value is maxed at 50,000 points.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>There are only two ways to increase the end of ball bonus: press a lit top rollover button, or hit the upper of the two yellow standup targets on the right. Each bonus advance is worth 1,000 points in base bonus; max base bonus is 10,000. The first bonus advance is never given for free, meaning it is possible to drain with 0 points in end of ball bonus. Making the upper right kicker lane qualifies 10x bonus; there are no other bonus multipliers, and the 10x bonus is never given for free. Max bonus is 10x 10,000 = 100,000 points. End of ball bonus is extremely trivial if you do not have the multiplier, but matters a lot if you have earned the 10x.</p>

<p>Tilt ends the ball in play only. Maximum 1 extra ball per ball in play. There is no mid-ball bonus collect or any kind of bonus holdover.</p>
