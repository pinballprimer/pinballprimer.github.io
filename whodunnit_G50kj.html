<h1>WHO dunnit (Bally Williams, 1995) (Work in progress)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>WHO dunnit's points are in its multiballs. To play Roof Multiball, shoot the Phone until you are able to pick the correct suspect; then shoot the indicated orbit followed by the Phone again to start multiball. To play Basement Multiball, shoot the Lower shot in the center to take the elevator to the basement, then shoot the Stop shot in the center to select the mode. If you're desperate or feeling lucky, shoot the right lane repeatedly to play Roulette, where you can bet up to your entire point total on a 50/50 chance roulette spin.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Starting a game</h3>

<p>At the very beginning of a game, you are asked to choose Novice or Regular game. Novice game is a one-ball game, but with 2 minutes of unlimited ball save at the start. Regular is a conventional 3- or 5-ball game. In a competitive setting, Regular game is always played.</p>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>The plunge on WHO dunnit arcs across the table. There are two flavors of skill shot.<br>The normal skill shot is a plunge that hits one of the Taxi targets. One Taxi target is lit at a time, moving back and forth across the bank. Hit the lit target to score the skill shot. T skill shot awards 10,000,000 points, and increases by 10,000,000 each time a skill shot is made. The A skill shot scores a Clue, which is a big-points award. The X skill shot advances the bonus multiplier. The I skill shot lights Roulette. Missing a skill shot just lights that letter in the word Taxi and starts normal play.</p>

<p>The super skill shot is a softer plunge that ends up in a somewhat-obscured lane just below the I target in the Taxi bank. This super skill shot scores 20,000,000 points (increasing by 20,000,000 each time), a Clue, a bonus multiplier, and a lock toward Basement Multiball. This is the preferred choice as a skill shot. WHO dunnit follows the "3-switch" rule of playfield validation, meaning the ball has to hit 3 different switches anywhere in the game before the ball is considered in play; this means that, in general, a missed super skill shot can be allowed to drain for an additional attempt. To confirm this, watch the dot display and listen to the music; if the game is still in skill shot mode, the ball can be drained for free.</p>

<h3>Catching Suspects</h3>

<p>The in-game goal of WHO dunnit is to solve crime cases by figuring out who committed murders. Doing so is a multi-step process.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Step 1: Collecting Clues.</i> Shoot the Taxi standup targets near the left orbit entrance to light them. Making a lit left in lane lights the right ramp for Taxi Chase, and making a lit right in lane lights the left orbit for Taxi Chase; shooting either of these when lit for Taxi Chase spots a Taxi letter. Completing Taxi awards a Clue. The first Clue collected during one crime case scores 10,000,000 points, and subsequent Clues each score 10,000,000 more than the last. There are 5 Clues in total. If you collect all 5 Clues before solving the case, the Telephone will be lit for an extra ball.</li>
	<li><i>Step 2: Interrogating Suspects.</i> Every time a Clue is collected, the Telephone lane on the left is lit to interrogate a suspect. The game will ask one of the four non-victim characters about the victim itself; one of the four is always the killer. Non-killer characters always talk about the killer. After interrogating a suspect, the Telephone will be lit for Whodunnit.</li>
	<li><i>Step 3: Accusing a Suspect.</i> After interrogating a suspect, shooting the Telephone lets you accuse a suspect. Accusing the wrong suspect scores 20,000,000, then 30,000,000, then 40,000,000 points; it may be worthwhile to do this intentionally so that you can keep collecting Clues toward lighting extra ball. Accusing the correct suspect starts Chase the Killer.</li>
	<li><I>Step 4: Chase the Killer.</i> You have about 15 seconds to shoot either the right ramp or the left orbit depending on whether the game tells you to shoot the left or right Taxi Chase. The indicated orbit changes every few seconds. If you do not make the indicated orbit in time, Step 4 ends and you score 25,000,000 points, and a new crime case begins. If you do make an orbit, the Telephone is lit for a hurry-up that starts at 100,000,000 and counts down quickly to 25,000,000. If you do not collect the hurry-up in time, another Taxi Chase shot is needed. If you do collect the hurry-up, Roof Multiball begins.</li>
	<li><i>Step 5: Roof Multiball.</i> 4-ball multiball. All shots score a jackpot equal to the value collected from the hurry-up at the end of step 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>When multiball ends, when the Taxi Chase if failed, or if the ball drains anytime during step 4 or 5, the case ends and a new case begins.</p>

<h3>Elevator modes</h3>

<p>In the center of the table is a wide flip ramp that leads to 3 different lanes. From left to right, the lanes are Up, Exit, and Down. Making the Up or Down lanes moves the elevator one floor. Making the Exit lane starts the mode corresponding to the currently selected floor. When moving up or down, floors corresponding to already-played modes are skipped. From bottom to top, the modes are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Basement: instantly starts Basement Multiball, explained later.</li>
	<li>Main Floor: instantly lights Slots at the right scoop and Roulette at the right lane.</li>
	<li>2nd floor: completes the current spelling of Taxi, awards a Clue, and lights the Phone.</li>
	<li>3rd floor: score a piece of Evidence or try to choose Whodunnit (player's choice), and also score 25,000,000 points</li>
	<li>4th floor: starts the Slot machine</li>
	<li>5th floor: score a piece of Evidence or try to choose Whodunnit (player's choice), and also score 25,000,000 points</li>
	<li>6th floor: awards a piece of Equipment</li>
	<li>7th floor: Elevator Madness, a quick 2-ball multiball. For as long as there are 2 balls in play, any shot to the Elevator scores a random multiple of 5,000,000 points between 10,000,000 and 35,000,000 inclusive. After about 20 seconds, ball save ends, and the retractable 3-bank of standup targets starts moving up and down to make shots harder.</li>
	<li>8th floor: question a suspect or try to choose Whodunnit (player's choice)</li>
	<li>Penthouse: if you have not collected a Penthouse Key fromt he lower right standup target, you cannot start this mode and will need to come back to it. If you have collected a Penthouse Key, Penthouse Party begins. Penthouse Party is a 20-second single ball mode. All shots are lit for 10,000,000 points; making any shot increases the value of the next shot by 10,000,000 points. If there is a maximum shot value during Penthouse Party, it is at least 100,000,000 points. If you can whack the ball up the center flip ramp repeatedly, you can earn 500,000,000 points or more in this mode.</li>
	<li>Roof: can only be chosen if all 10 other elevator modes have been played, and instantly starts the Catch the Killer sequence just as if a correct suspect had been identified.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Slot Machine</h3>

<p>At the start of the ball, the Roulette right lane and the right scoop are lit for Spin. The Main Floor elevator mode lights the right scoop for Spin, and the 4th Floor elevator mode starts Slots Spin. You can also nudge the slot reels when they are stopped by shooting the left orbit when it is not lit for Taxi Chase, which puts the ball in the pop bumpers, where each bumper moves a reel one position. Reels cannot be nudged if they are part of a pair or a three of a kind. When the reels are spun on their own, getting 3 different symbols with no Wilds scores 5,000,000 points. If the center reel is on Wild Choice, you get to pick whether you want the left or right award. If there is a pair, but not a three of a kind, a "second chance" starts, where shooting any flashing shot (Telephone, Exit, Roulette, right scoop) finishes the 3 of a kind. Possible awards include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>3 Bars: 100,000,000 points</li>
	<li>3 Magnifying Glasses: earn 1 piece of Equipment</li>
	<li>3 Fingerprints: earn 1 Clue</li>
	<li>3 Multiball symbols: instantly start Basement Multiball</li>
	<li>3 Jackpots: instantly score the current Basement Multiball jackpot</li>
	<li>3 Extra Balls: instant extra ball</li>
	<li>3 Question Marks: start Elevator Madness quick multiball</li>
</ul>

<p>If Tournament Mode is enabled, full Slot machine spins always lead to awards being given in the same order, though I have not been able to determine exactly what that order is. <br>The out lanes can be lit for Spin; only one is lit at a time, moved via flipper lane change. If a Second Chance starts from an out lane spin, or if the spin awards Multiball or Elevator Madness, your turn will continue.</p>

<h3>Basement Multiball</h3>

<p>There are 3 ways to start Basement Multiball: the Basement elevator mode, the Multiball award on the slot machine, or by virtually locking 3 balls in the super skill shot lane in the lower left (which requires a lot of luck and ricochets and is never practical). Basement Multiball is usually a 3-ball multiball, but seems to be 2-ball instead of it is started from an out lane slot machine spin. In Basement Multiball, the Roulette right lane and the Sewer right scoop always score jackpots. Jackpots start at 75,000,000 points and increase by 1,000,000 per pop bumper hit during multiball. If you have collected the Revolver piece of Equipment, each bumper adds 5,000,000 to the jackpot instead. This is an extremely lucrative feature and should be taken seriously at all times.</p>

<h3>Equipment</h3>

<p>There are 4 pieces of Equipment in the game, which boost various other features. The Revolver causes the pop bumpers to increase the Basement Multiball jackpot faster. The Magnifying Glass causes the next shot to the Telephone to eliminate 1 suspect if the Telephone was not lit for anything else. The Flashlight makes it so that the next shot to the Telephone awards the Magnifying Glass and the next shot to the Sewer right scoop awards the Map.<br>Equipment is earned from the 6th floor elevator award, the 3 Magnifying Glasses slot machine award, or by making two right ramp Train Combos.</p>

<p>When shooting the Sewer right hole, as long as it is not lit for Spin slot machine or Jackpot:</p>
<ul>	
	<li>If you do not have the Flashlight or Map, you earn 1,000,000 points multiplied by the number of times the Sewer has been shot so far.</li>
	<li>If you have the Flashlight, you earn the Map.</li>
	<li>If you have both the Flashlight and the Map, the Sewer will give a mystery award, which is frequently Interrogate Suspect, Find Evidence, or Light Whodunnit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Roulette</h3>

<p>The right spinner lane governs Roulette. Each spin of the spinner changes what the next Roulette value will be. If your score is less than 250,000,000 points, the possible Roulette bets will be multiples of 25,000,000 up to 250,000,000. If your score is more than 250,000,000, the game considers your "modified score" to be your score rounded down to the nearest 10,000,000, and the Roulette bets will be 10%, 20%, 30%, ..., 90%, or 100% of this modified score. If there is a maximum Roulette bet, it is at least 1,900,000,000 points. To light Roulette, either shoot the unlit Roulette lane, play the Main Floor elevator mode, or make one right ramp Train Combo. To change whether you bet on Red or Black at the next Roulette game, hit the post target between the left orbit and the Telephone (Red) or to the right of the center flip ramp (Black).</p>

<p>When you shoot the lit Roulette lane, you get the choice to place a bet or pass for now. If you pass, Roulette unlights and must be relit to try again. If you bet, a DMD animation plays and the game chooses Red or Black. To the best of my knowledge, this is purely a 50/50 chance, with no way to influence the result and no chance that the Roulette lands on Green instead. If you win, the value of your bet is added to your score; if you lose, the value is subtracted. If the bet you made was more than your current score (only possible with 250,000,000 points or less), you will go back to 0 points if you lose- there are no negative points. Regardless of whether you win or lose the Roulette, you will always increase the bonus multiplier by 1 after spinning, unless the bonus multiplier has already reached its maximum value of 25x.</p>

<p>If Tournament Mode is enabled, you will always win the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc., spins of Roulette. I have not tested whether this means the 2nd, 4th... plays are always losses.</p>

<h3>Train Combos</h3>

<p>Shooting the right ramp starts Train Combo, where additional consecutive shots to the right ramp without missing give additional awards. The first Train Combo requires 2 shots and lights the Roulette. The second Train Combo requires 3 shots and awards the Flashlight piece of Equipment. The third Train Combo requires 4 shots and lights Extra Ball at the Telephone. Any further Train Combos are just "go for as long as you can", with the longest combo being able to enter their initials as the Loop Champion.</p>

<h3>Midnight Madness</h3>

<p>If WHO dunnit's internal real-time clock hits 12:00 AM during a game, all balls will be allowed to drain the playfield and Midnight Madness starts. Midnight Madness is a 4-ball multiball where every switch in the game scores 3,000,000 points until there is only one ball left in play.</p>

<h3>Mystery</h3>

<p>Hitting the Penthouse Key target int he lower right lights the Mystery target in the lower left. The Mystery always tries to give you an award that is helpful for your current situation; most of the time, this involves completing the current spelling of Taxi. It can be used during Penthouse Party to spot a Penthouse award. I have not tested other scenarios.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>WHO dunnit has a conventional in/out lane setup. One of the four in/out lanes is lit at any given time; flipper lane change can be used to rotate which one is lit. A ball down a lit out lane earns a free spin of the slot machine, and a ball down an in lane lights the opposite Taxi Chase (left orbit or right ramp).</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is calculated as 5,000,000 points per crime case started, plus 1,000,000 per Clue collected, plus 5,000,000 per full Slot machine spin, plus 20,000,000 per crime case finished (defined as starting Roof Multiball), all multiplied by the bonus multiplier. Bonus multiplier is advanced by making super skill shots or making a bet at Roulette and goes up to 25x. Base bonus and bonus multiplier are always held from ball to ball, so end of ball bonus can be quite lucrative early in the game.</p>
