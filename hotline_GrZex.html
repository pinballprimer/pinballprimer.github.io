<h1>Hot Line / Big Strike (Williams, 1966)</h1>

<p>Hot Line is the replay version, and Big Strike is the add-a-ball version. As far as I can tell, the only difference between the two is that Specials award extra balls on Big Strike and free games on Hot Line.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Collect A and B at the top of the table whenever possible from the standup targets near the bumpers or the top rollover lanes. When A and B are both collected, shoot the gate in the upper right for 300 points, a replunge, and a spotted completion of the entire current letter in Hot Line. Letters can also be completed by draining down a near out lane or rolling over all lit rollover buttons in the center of the playfield.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Bumpers and A-B</h3>

<p>A can be collected from the left top lane or upper left standup target; the lane scores 100 points and the target scores 10. B can be collected from the right top lane or the center standup target, which both score 100 points. When A is collected, the yellow bumpers will be lit for 10 points instead of 1. When B is collected, the red bumpers will be lit for 10 points instead of 1. The blue center bumper always scores 1 point (the attached picture is of an old virtual version of the game with an incorrect bumper cap). The top green passive bumper scores 10 points or 100 when lit, and is lit alternately based on 1-point switch hits.</p>

<p>When both A and B have been collected, the upper right gate is open. Making the gate scores 300 points, completes the current Hot Line letter, and resets A and B, which also unlights all red and yellow bumpers.</p>

<h3>Hot Line letters</h3>

<p>There are 17 rollover buttons in the center of the table, making a concentric grid shape. All buttons score 1 point. Roll over a lit button to unlight it. Unlighting all lit buttons scores 300 points and a letter in Hot Line. The lit buttons themselves form the shape of whatever Hot Line letter you are trying to spell. Collecting the letter I lights the far out lanes alternately for Special based on 1-point switch hits. Completing Hot Line also scores a Special.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes, with flippers backing up directly to the slingshots, and there are 2 out lanes on each side. The near out lanes score 100 points or 300 and spot Hot Line letter when lit; they can be lit all of the time, none of the time, or alternately based on 1-point switch hits. Far out lanes score 100 points and can be lit for Special once the I in Hot Line is collected.</p>
