<h1>Zodiac / Planets (Williams, 1971)</h1>

<p>Both games support 2 players. Zodiac is a replay version, while Planets is a rare non-replay version where Specials can only score points. All other rules and scoring are identical.</p>

<h2>Game rules</h2>

<p>Plunge the ball by pressing the large button on the game's apron, which sends the ball upwards between the flippers and onto the playfield. The spinning disc in the playfield scores 100 points and a bonus advance per spin; which bonus is advanced depends on which lower rollover button was pressed most recently (Sun for left, Moon for right). There are 8 standup targets at the top of the table. Target #1 scores 100 points and a bonus advance; if targets 2, 3, and 4 have all been hit, target #1 activates a magnet that collects the Sun bonus instead, worth up to 20,000 points. The 4 right targets of the upper right work the same; target 8 in the top right corner scores 100 points and a bonus advance, or collects the Moon bonus if targets 5, 6, and 7 have all been hit. Making the upper side lanes lights A (left) or B (right); collecting both A and B scores an extra ball; collecting A lights the left out lane for Special and the secret passage on the left for Zodiac advance; collecting B lights the same features on the right. The Zodiac signs are a carryover award; collect the 12th zodiac sign to score 1, 2, or 3 Specials depending on game settings. Specials can score a free game or 10,000 points on Zodiac; they always score points on Planets.</p>
