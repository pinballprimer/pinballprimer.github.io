<h1>Round Up (Bally, 1971)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<h3>Round Up is about spinning the wheel on the playfield as many times as possible. On the plunge, try to both hit the Qualifies Hole for Spinner rollover button and land in the top saucer. Once the ball is in the flipper area: from the left flipper, aim for the Double Spin Value target in the top left, and from the right flipper, aim for the upper right saucer to spin the wheel. The wheel awards between 2,000 and 5,000 points and can have its value doubled- far exceeding anything else in the game. The white mushroom bumper raises the center post, and the red mushroom bumpers lower it.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top of the playfield</h3>

<p>There are two rollover buttons at the top of the playfield. The higher/further left of the two lights the passive bumper in the top left of the game for 1,000 points instead of 100. The lower/further right of the two buttons qualifies the top hole to spin the wheel. Always try to light the top hole and ignore the passive bumper; an ideal plunge will both light and land in the top hole.</p>

<h3>Top lanes and pop bumpers</h3>

<p>The left top lane scores 1,000 points and lights the yellow pop bumper. The right top lane scores 1,000 points and lights the green pop bumper. The center hole scores 500 points, or spins the wheel when lit, and lights both the yellow and green bumpers. The hole is lit by making the rollover button directly above it. Pop bumpers score 10 points, or 100 when lit. The blue pop bumper is always lit; the green and yellow pop bumpers, as well as the top passive bumper, turn off at the end of each ball if they are lit.</p>

<h3>The Wheel</h3>

<p>Landing in the top saucer when lit, or landing in the right saucer at any time, spins the wheel depicted in the middle of the playfield. When the wheel is spun, you earn points equal to whichever value is lit when the wheel stops. There is a 40% chance of landing on 2,000 points, and a 20% chance each of 3,000, 4,000, or 5,000 points. The standup target at the end of the long narrow lane in the upper left scores 1,000 points and doubles the value of the next spin. The double light is turned off after a wheel value is collected or when the ball drains.</p>

<h3>Mushroom bumpers and center post</h3>

<p>All mushroom bumpers score 100 points. The white mushroom bumper on the middle left raises the center post, which temporarily and completely blocks the gap between the flippers. The two red mushroom bumpers on either side of the path toward the right saucer lower the center post. The blue mushroom bumper in the lower left is occasionally lit for extra ball; this is toggled by 10-point switches hit anywhere in the game.</p>

<h3>Lower rollover buttons and bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are two rollover buttons in the lower half of the table. The button above the Wheel lights opens the free ball gate, while the button to the left of the Wheel closes the gate. The gate is located in the right out lane and redirects the ball back to the shooter lane for a replunge. The gate closes when it is used, when the ball drains, or if the game is tilted. The right out lane scores 500 points. The left out lane scores 1,000 points and has no gate, kickback, or other protection.</p>

<p>There are no in lanes. Full size three inch flippers are used. Slingshots score 10 points. There is no end of ball bonus. Tilt ends the ball in play only.</p>
