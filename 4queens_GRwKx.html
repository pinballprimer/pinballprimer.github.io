<h1>4 Queens (Bally, 1970)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with 4 Aces (Williams, 1970) or 4 Square (Gottlieb, 1971).</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>If playing for points, shoot the center saucer as often as possible. The center saucer closes the flipper gap and is worth a varying amount of points, up to 5,000, changing with every 10-point switch hit. This scoring far outweighs anything else in the game.<br>If playing for Specials/free games, complete the A-B-C-D sequence in order repeatedly by hitting mushroom bumpers: 3 completions lights the center top lane for a Special, and 4 completions instantly awards a free game. Lit center standup targets spot the next A-B-C-D letter.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>On the plunge: top lanes and upper right saucer</h3>

<p>The ball can go through any of 3 rollover lanes, or a separate 4th lane that leads to a saucer. Left top lane scores 100 points and lights the two yellow bumpers for 100 points instead of 10. Center top lane scores 1,000 points and is lit for Special after A-B-C-D has been completed in order 3 or more times. Right top lane scores 100 points and lights the center blue bumper for 100 points instead of 10. The top saucer scores 300 points or 3,000 when lit; it is lit alternately based on 10 point switch hits, and also spots the next letter in A-B-C-D if it is made when lit. The saucer spits the ball down-left, and on a well-adjusted machine, the top saucer has a high chance of throwing the ball into the center saucer.</p>

<h3>Lighting Queens: A-B-C-D sequence</h3>

<p>There are 4 mushroom bumpers around the game: A in the top left, B in the lower right, C in the top right, and D in the lower left. At any time, one of the four will be lit; the A will be lit at the start of the game. All mushroom bumpers always give 1,000 points. Hitting the lit mushroom bumper will unlight that number and light the next letter. Collecting a lit A-B-C-D in that order lights one Queen and resets the sequence to A. Progress on A-B-C-D and the number of completed sequences are preserved from ball to ball. Every completed A-B-C-D starting with the 3rd lights the center top lane for special. Every completed A-B-C-D starting with the 4th also scores an instant special.</p>

<p>The two center standup targets and upper right saucer are lit alternately based on 10-point switch hits to spot the current letter in the sequence. Center standup targets always score 100 points. Upper right saucer scores 300 points, or 3,000 when lit.</p>

<h3>Center saucer and zipper flippers</h3>

<p>The center saucer value rotates between 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, and 5,000 points, every time a 10-point switch is scored. Making the saucer scores the currently lit value and zips the flippers together, temporarily blocking off the center drain as a reward. The flippers are reopened if the ball triggers either of the wall switches positioned just below the B and D mushroom bumpers.</p>

<p>The center saucer is the most reliable way to score points more than 1,000 at a time. However, the flippers are usually strong enough that the ball will travel too fast and not settle into the saucer if shot directly. Try to enter the saucer by either using nudging to poke the ball in the center saucer's direction on its way down out of the bumper area, or by shooting the top right saucer and hoping it kicks out toward the center saucer.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table, other than zipper flippers</h3>

<p>Slingshots score 10 points. Out lanes score 1,000 points. There are no in lanes, and the flippers back up directly to the slingshots.</p>

<p>There are no extra balls. There is no end of ball bonus. Specials cannot be set to be worth points. Tilt ends the entire game, not just the current ball in play.</p>
