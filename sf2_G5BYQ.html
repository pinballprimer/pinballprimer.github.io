<h1>Street Fighter II (Premier Gottlieb, 1993)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Street Fighter II is an otherwise-well-balanced game that gives ludicrous awards for completing one of three major tasks. As such, pick one of those three tasks and focus on it, with the goal of seeing it through to earn an ending award worth hundreds of millions of points:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Shoot shots lit white to defeat fighters. After defeating 12, make every lit shot during Champion Challenge single-ball wizard mode for 500,000,000 points.</li>
	<li>Start multiball by defeating an even number of fighters, then follow the lit shots around the table until you advance to Super Jackpot, worth a repeatable 300,000,000 points.</li>
	<li>Shoot the lower left scoop repeatedly until Torpedo is spelled, which starts Torpedo Multiball, where almost every switch in the game is worth 3,000,000 points of end of ball bonus.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>The skill shot has two parts. Part 1 is a timed full plunge. Listen or watch the DMD for "ready, set, shoot!". Plunge the ball when Shoot is said/appears. If the plunger spring is the correct strength and the shot was timed well, Chun-Li's bracelet will hit the bullseye on the DMD, and part 2 of the skill shot begins with a value of 20,000,000 points. If you were early or late, the game will tell you that, and part 2 of the skill shot will start with a value of 5,000,000, 10,000,000, or 15,000,000 points depending on how early or late you were.<br>Part 2 of the skill shot is a hurry-up with a starting value equal to whatever value was locked in during part 1. To score the hurry-up and complete the skill shot, hit the Bracelet target in the upper right, which will be lit with a white triangle. This target can only be directly shot from the upper left flipper, which the ball is fed to after part 1, but it's not too uncommon to ricochet into the Bracelet target by accident. <br>If the ball drains quickly and ball save is activated, the skill shot hurry-up will still be available and will continue to count down when the saved ball re-enters play.</p>

<h3>Defeating Fighters</h3>

<p>The main progression goal of Street Fighter II is to defeat the 12 playable characters from the arcade game Street Fighter II: Champion Edition by shooting their corresponding shots on the playfield. When a shot is lit white, make that shot to defeat the character. As many as 3 characters will be lit at once, but this can be decreased to as little as 1 lit character if the game is set to harder settings or if Champion Challenge wizard mode has already been played. Characters usually light in the same order. Below is a list of the characters in roughly the order they are lit alongside where their shot is located. Defeating a character gives a choice between two awards; the choices themselves are based not on who was defeated, but how many fighters have been defeated. The second list below contains the awards available after each completed fighter.</p>
<ul>
	<li>M. Bison: shoot the lower right scoop.</li>
	<li>Sagat: shoot underneath the left ramp. The ball will make a small u-turn under the left ramp and land in the center hole at the end of Dhalsim's lane.</li>
	<li>E. Honda: shoot the lower left scoop.</li>
	<li>Vega: shoot under the right ramp to land in a hole at the top of the game.</li>
	<li>Ryu: shoot the "spiral" in the upper right by using the upper left flipper. You get points for each lap around the Spiral the ball makes, but the ball just needs to end up in the hole in the Spiral to defeat Ryu.</li>
	<li>Zangief: the left ramp is now lowered. Shoot the left ramp and the ball will follow the curved plastic, then fall into the center hole to defeat Zangief.</li>
	<li>Balrog: shoot the lower right scoop again. Having Balrog lit requires defeating M. Bison first.</li>
	<li>Blanka: shoot the left orbit. If Blanka is lit at the start of a ball, simply plunging the ball will defeat him, because part 1 of the Skill Shot places the ball in the hole at the end of the left orbit.</li>
	<li>Guile: shoot the popper in the upper right, which requires a precise thread-the-needle shot that goes between the center pop bumper structure and the Bracelet target/Spiral entrance.</li>
	<li>Dhalsim: shoot the lane just to the right of the left ramp. The Zangief and Sagat shots both shoot this hole as well, but Zangief drops into the hole from the left ramp and Sagat makes a u-turn and enters the hole from behind.</li>
	<li>Chun-Li: the right ramp is now lowered. Shoot up it to reach the clock flipper above the top of the game. To defeat Chun-Li, you must shoot past this flipper and land in the top left hole. If the clock flipper, which depicts Chun-Li's spinning kick, gets in the way, the ball will come to the right in lane and Chun-Li is not awarded.</li>
	<li>Ken: shoot the Spiral again, with the same rules as Ryu.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to defeat the fighters in an order other than the exact one listed here. If that happens, both Ryu and Ken or both M. Bison and Balrog can be qualified at once. However, you cannot defeat two fighters with just one shot. Making the shot in question will award one fighter, then immediately light the same feature to award its second fighter on the next shot.</p>

<p>Below are the victory awards for defeating fighters. Named modes are italicized and discussed after the list of awards.</p>
<ol>
	<li>3,000,000 points or <i>Car Crunch</i></li>
	<li>5,000,000 points or multiball (see next section)</li>
	<li>5,000,000 points or <i>Roaming Ninjas</i></li>
	<li>10,000,000 points or multiball</li>
	<li><i>Hurry-Up E.B.</i> or <i>Count-Up</i></li>
	<li>"Add 2 to Guile" (gives progress toward the Guile award, which is either an extra ball or 50,000,000 points) or multiball</li>
	<li>10,000,000 points or <i>1-2 Punch</i></li>
	<li>"Add 3 to Torpedo" (gives progress toward Torpedo Multiball) or regular multiball</li>
	<li>10,000,000 points or <i>Double Round</i></li>
	<li>Complete FIGHTER (instantly lights a Special on the in/out lanes) or multiball</li>
	<li>No award for the 11th fighter</li>
	<li><i>Champion Challenge wizard mode</i></li>
</ol>

<p>Car Crunch: a mini-game played using the flipper and ball located underneath the playfield. You have a few seconds to push the car toy as far back as it will go by hitting it with the pinball. The right flipper controls the mini-playfield's flipper. If you push the car back all the way during the time limit, you win the mini-game. The first Car Crunch has 5 seconds on the clock and scores 5,000,000 points. The second Car Crunch has 3 seconds on the clock and scores 10,000,000 points. After that, all Car Crunch rounds have just 2 seconds on the clock and score 30,000,000 points. In addition to being a possible award for defeating 1 fighter, Car Crunch is also started by shooting the left orbit 3 times when it is not lit for Blanka.</p>

<p>Roaming Ninjas: a 20-second timed mode. Of the 8 shots that house at least one fighter (both lower holes, both ramps, the left orbit, Dhalsim lane, Guile lane, and the Spiral), two will be lit at a time. Which two shots are lit rotates every 5 seconds. You can get credit for multiple lit shots during a single 5-second cycle. After 4 lit shots, the mode instantly ends, no matter how much time was left. Scoring progression in this mode has liberal, moderate, and conservative settings:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Liberal (default): 5,000,000, then 20,000,000, then 50,000,000, then 100,000,000</li>
	<li>Moderate: 5,000,000, then 15,000,000, then 35,000,000, then 70,000,000</li>
	<li>Conservative: 5,000,000, then 10,000,000, then 15,000,000, then 20,000,000</li>
</ul>

<p>Hurry-up EB: the extra ball standup target in the center of the game is lit for about 15 seconds. If this award has been collected once during the game already, it is replaced with 10,000,000 points in the selection instead.</p>

<p>Count-Up: a constantly increasing value is shown on the DMD. The value starts at 3,000,000 points, counts up to 10,000,000 by 50,000 at a time, pauses briefly, then counts up by 1,000,000s up to a maximum of 48,000,000, then abruptly times out. Shoot the lower right scoop to earn whatever value is currently displayed. If you wait even slightly too long, you get nothing.</p>

<p>1-2 Punch: a 20-second mode. Shoot Blanka first, then shoot Ken & Ryu's Spiral shot. Doing so successfully awards an extra ball. If an extra ball has already been earned from this feature, you will get 25,000,000 points for shooting Blanka, then 50,000,000 for shooting the Spiral instead.</p>

<p>Double Round: a 20-second mode. 4 of the 8 shots that correspond to a fighter are lit red at random. Making a lit shot will unlight it. Shots in this mode score 5,000,000 points, then 10,000,000 points, then 20,000,000 points, then double your entire current score. For some reason, this can be collected multiple times in one game.</p>

<p>Champion Challenge: an untimed single ball wizard mode. Every shot that can eliminate a character will be flashing. Making a flashing shot scores 5,000,000 points and unlights it. The Spiral and lower right scoop only need to be shot once each; however, the ramps each need 2 shots, where one shot goes under the ramp and the other shot goes up it. The second right ramp shot does require you to get past the spinning Chun-Li clock flipper again, making it the most annoying shot of the mode. Making all 10 required shots scores 500,000,000 points plus an instant Special and allows you to enter your initials right away as the game's most recent Master. When all of this is done, play continues as normal, with the fighter progression restarting from scratch.<br>If you complete Champion Challenge twice in one game, the second completion awards 1,000,000,000 points and 2 Specials. I have not verified if the value for a third completed Champion Challenge continues to increase.</p>

<h3>Standard Multiball</h3>

<p>Multiball is offered as one of the options you can choose after defeating fighters 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. You can also start multiball by making 4 shots to the Sagat lane under the left ramp when neither Sagat nor Zangief is lit, but this is not worth the trouble; just knock out a couple more fighters and start multiball that way.</p>

<p>Standard multiball is always a 2-ball mode. There is absolutely no ball save in multiball. In multiball, shoot the lit fighters shots to score jackpots. At first, the two lower scoops are lit for jackpots. Making a jackpot unlights that shot and lights another. The sequence in which shots are lit for jackpots is always E.Honda and M.Bison -> Vega -> Sagat -> Dhalsim -> Blanka -> Guile -> Ken & Ryu's Spiral. The first jackpot scores 5,000,000 points, and each subsequent jackpot scores 5,000,000 more than the last, with the 7th jackpot scoring 35,000,000 points. The 8th and final jackpot is a super jackpot worth 300,000,000 points. If you do not make it all the way to the super jackpot, your progress is kept intact until the next time you play the standard multiball. If you start a multiball when Blanka's left orbit is one of the shots lit for jackpot, the jackpot will be given immediately when multiball begins. What happens after the super jackpot depends on game settings.</p>
<ul>
	<li>On easy settings: once you light the super jackpot, it will always be available at that shot for the rest of the game, and it can never be reset or moved.</li>
	<li>On medium settings: once you collect one super jackpot, you can continue to earn additional super jackpots at the same shot for the duration of multiball, but once that multiball ends, you will be reset to the beginning of the jackpot progression the next time you start multiball.</li>
	<li>On hard settings: the jackpot progression will be reset to the beginning immediately after one super jackpot is scored.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the game is set to easy or medium settings, consider avoiding one easier lit jackpot shot so that repeatable super jackpots are available at something easier to shoot. If you collect all the jackpots in order, your super jackpot will be stuck at the ultra-narrow Guile lane or the upper-flipper-exclusive Spiral shot, which is significantly harder to make repeatedly then Blanka's left orbit, Dhalsim's lane, or either lower scoop. This is especially important on the Easy settings, since once the super jackpot is lit, it's stuck there for the whole game and can never be moved, which can have ramifications of billions of points.</p>

<h3>Torpedo Multiball</h3>

<p>Torpedo Multiball is started by spelling the word Torpedo. Torpedo letters are earned by shooting the lower left saucer when it is not lit for E.Honda. After spelling Torpedo, shoot E.Honda's saucer one more time to start Torpedo Multiball. For the first Torpedo Multiball only, you can also earn Torpedo letters and start Torpedo Multiball from the lower right saucer whenever it is not lit to defeat M.Bison or Balrog.</p>

<p>Torpedo Multiball is started by plunging two additional balls to make a 3-ball multiball. Like standard multiball, there is absolutely no ball save and no add-a-ball feature. The Torpedo Bonus value starts at 3,000,000 points. Nearly every switch in the game other than the slingshots adds a further 3,000,000 points to the Torpedo Bonus, which has no limit that I've ever encountered. Torpedo Bonus is only scored at the end of the current ball in play, so don't tilt on any ball where Torpedo Multiball is played. The Torpedo Bonus cannot be multiplied in any way. If Torpedo Multiball is played multiple times during a single ball, the Torpedo Bonus will carry over and accumulate across the different multiballs. The best way to increase the Torpedo Bonus quickly is to shoot in the direction Dhalsim or Guile's lanes with the goal of getting balls stuck between the pop bumper and the standup targets above them. A strong Torpedo Multiball should add at least 100,000,000 points to the Torpedo Bonus.<br>The per-switch value of the Torpedo Bonus can be set to 2,000,000 on hard settings or 5,000,000 on easy settings instead of the default 3,000,000.</p>

<h3>Additional shot features</h3>

<p>When the major shots of the game are not lit for defeating a character, they will be lit yellow for another feature. Some of these features have been touched on in previous sections, but they will all be discussed in detail here.<br>In front of each character shot is a red insert labelled Double, which moves to a different shot each time a slingshot is scored. Making a shot lit for Double when that shot is lit for a character has no effect, but if the shot is lit yellow for an alternate feature, the feature will be doubled.</p>

<p><i>E.Honda lower left scoop:</i> shots award 1 (or 2 when doubled) letter in Torpedo. Flashes furiously when Torpedo Multiball is ready.
<br><i>Blanka left orbit:</i> gives credit for 1 (or 2 when doubled) Blanka shot. At 3 Blanka shots, Car Crunch is played. Flashes when Car Crunch is ready.
<br><i>Left ramp:</i> each shot to the left ramp alternates whether the left ramp is raised or lowered. If the ramp is lowered, shooting it scores 3,000,000 points (or 6,000,000 when doubled). If the ramp is raised, shooting underneath it will cause Sagat to crush 1 barrel (or 2 when doubled). Crushing 4 barrels starts standard Multiball.
<br><i>Dhalsim lane:</i> scores 2,000,000 points (or 4,000,000 when doubled).
<br><i>Guile lane:</i> each shot awards 1 letter (or 2 when doubled) in the word Guile. Spelling Guile causes the Guile lane to flash; shooting it again scores an extra ball for the first spelling of Guile or 50,000,000 points for subsequent spellings. I am pretty sure that the extra ball or 50,000,000 awards cannot be doubled.
<br><i>Spiral loop:</i> each loop within the Spiral awards 1,000,000 points the first time. For subsequent Spiral shots, the per-loop value increases by 1,000,000 points, up to a maximum of 2,000,000 (on hard settings), 4,000,000 (on medium settings), or 6,000,000 (on easy settings).
<br><i>Right ramp:</i> if the right ramp is raised, shooting under it awards a Vega mystery award, or 2 separate mystery awards if Double is lit. Mystery awards include points, start multiball, light extra ball, or award letters in Torpedo, Guile, or Fighter. Once the mystery award(s) is/are collected, the ramp lowers. When the ramp is lowered, the Chun-Li clock flipper starts to spin. Making a full right ramp shot that avoids the clock flipper scores 5,000,000 points; making successive right ramp shots each award 5,000,000 more than the last. The right ramp re-raises when a Chun-Li shot is missed, and all point values are doubled if Double is lit.
<br><i>M.Bison lower right scoop:</i> if Torpedo Multiball has not yet been played, this scoop will also award Torpedo letters or start Torpedo Multiball. If Torpedo Multiball has already been played, this scoop gives an award that starts at 1,000,000 points and increases by 1,000,000 each time. This value does not seem to reset, and if there is a limit on the value of this award, it is at least 155,000,000 points. In my experience, advancing this award higher than approximately 30,000,000-40,000,000 points will sometimes cause the dot display to glitch out, showing incorrect and nonsensical scores and commas until another scoring switch is hit anywhere in the game. In rare cases, the game may force itself to display scores in 4-player mode even if there are not 4 players, or garbage numbers may be shown for the ball number or credit count. However, as far as I have observed, any glitches with the score are purely visual and temporary.</p>

<h3>Fighter letters</h3>

<p>Hitting one of the standup targets in the center of the table that faces to the left will unlight it, if it is lit. Unlighting both targets awards one letter in Fighter. Letters in Fighter can also be awarded from Vega's mystery award or as one of the options for defeating fighter #10. When Fighter is spelled, no more Fighter letters can be earned that ball, and one of the in/out lanes will be lit for a Special that can be moved with flipper lane change.</p>

<h3>Extra ball target</h3>

<p>The three standup targets in the back center of the game behind the pop bumper give progress toward lighting the extra ball target, which is the center of the three targets that are attached to the pop bumper and face the flippers. Game settings determine whether the 3 back targets need to be hit once each, twice each, or as two separate sets in order for the extra ball to be lit.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Street Fighter II has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes score 10,000 points and out lanes score 100,000 points. All in/out lanes can be lit for Special (which is moved via flipper lane change) once Fighter is spelled. There is no kickback. There is a center post between/below the flippers by default.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus on Street Fighter II unless you played Torpedo Multiball on the previous ball. All scoring from Torpedo Multiball is given during end of ball bonus; it cannot be multiplied, collected mid-ball, or carried from ball to ball.</p>

<h3>Competition note</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, Special scores 50,000,000 points and extra ball scores 20,000,000 points. However, if extra balls are entirely disabled, the "Hurry-up E.B." award will always be replaced with a flat 10,000,000 points, and the award for spelling Guile will always be a flat 50,000,000 points.</p>
