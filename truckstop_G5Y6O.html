<h1>Truck Stop (Bally Williams, 1988)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Shoot ramps to collect letters in City repeatedly. Lower ramps usually feed the upper flippers, and upper ramps usually feed the lower flippers. City advances increase the end of ball bonus, the lock and release for 2-ball multiball, and make progression toward the carryover jackpot. After completing all 5 cities, earn the jackpot by spelling City again within 50 seconds. Complete the inline drops then hit the target behind them to advance bonus multiplier; one ball's bonus can be well over 1,000,000 points. Unlight all 6 blue targets in the center to light a ramp red, which instantly spots an entire City.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>On the plunge</h3>

<p>The plunge on Truck Stop takes the path of the lower right ramp and is dropped off at the upper right flipper. Watch the back panel of the game carefully: the lit spinner value rotates between 100 points (unlit), 500 points, 1,000 points, 2,000 points, or 5,000 points per spin. When the ball gets about 2/3 of the way around its plunge route, it triggers a switch that locks in the currently lit spinner value. As far as I can tell, this spinner value is locked in for the rest of the ball and cannot be changed, so always try to get a high value. (The spinner itself is just above and to the left of the center inline drop targets, in front of the "left Truck Stop saucer".)</p>

<h3>City letters, including qualifying multiball and Jackpots</h3>

<p>Collect a letter in City by shooting any of the game's 4 ramps; C in the lower left, I in the upper left, T in the upper right, or Y in the lower right. Unlike many games that require you to spell a word repeatedly, Truck Stop does let you work ahead; you don't to finish the first spelling of City before collecting your second Y, for example. Spelling the word City advances you to the next city: in order, Los Angeles, Denver, Dallas, Chicago, and New York. There are 3 ways to spot City letters without using the ramps:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The two yellow mushroom bumpers in the upper half of the playfield start lit. Hitting a mushroom bumper unlights it and spots one letter in City. To relight the mushrooms, complete the inline drop targets, then hit the green standup target behind the inline drops before they reset.</li>
	<li>The "right Truck Stop saucer" above and to the right of the inline drop targets starts out lit for Spots Letter. Making this saucer spots a City letter and unlights the saucer. Make either in lane at any time to relight this saucer for Spots Letter.</li>
	<li>6 blue standup targets in the center of the playfield start out flashing. Flashing targets score 10,000 points; unlit targets score 5,000 points; hit a flashing target to unlight it. Unlight all 6 targets to light one of the game's 4 ramps with a red diamond, which completes the entire current City instead of awarding one letter.</li>
</ul>

<p>City letters do a great many things for gameplay.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Each City letter is worth 5,000 points in end of ball bonus. The game keeps track of the current card on the grid of lights plus up to 3 previously completed grids, for a maximum base end of ball bonus of 400,000 points.</li>
	<li>Reaching a certain number of completed Cities within a grid (2, by default; indicated by the flashing red city near the grid of lights) will qualify the left Truck Stop saucer for a lock. The lock stays on until made. Locking a ball adds 100,000 points to the Jackpot. Immediately after locking a ball, Release is lit at the left Truck Stop saucer for about 15 seconds. If the saucer is not made in this time, you must complete City again to relight the Release for 15 more seconds. Making the left Truck Stop saucer when lit for Release starts 2-ball multiball.</li>
		<ul><li>There is little reason to aim for multiball on Truck Stop. Its only real purpose is to introduce a second ball to play for more ramp shooting or blue standup target completions. The game manual indicates that a timed feature allows players to complete the entire current City grid by relocking both balls into the left Truck Stop saucer, but I have not been able to get this to occur, so it's either a cut feature or something that requires two shots so close together that it's not practical to attempt. To play multiball a second time, you need to complete the entire grid of lights, then work your way back to the flashing City on a new grid.</li></ul>
	<li>Completing all 5 Cities immediately starts a Jackpot chance. To score the Jackpot, spell the word City one more time within 50 seconds. You can't spot letters during a Jackpot chance, but there is a setting that ties the I and T together during a Jackpot chance, so you only need to make one upper ramp to award the Jackpot. The Jackpot starts at 1,000,000 points and increases by 100,000, up to a maximum of 6,000,000, every time a ball is locked for 2-ball multiball. The Jackpot is progressive, and builds up across players and games. When the Jackpot is collected, it is frozen, and all players will play for the same Jackpot value for the remainder of the game; after that game ends, the Jackpot will be reset back to 1,000,000 points. When the Jackpot is collected or the ball is drained during a Jackpot chance, the grid of lights will reset and the Destination Log super bonus will increase, and the 5 completions of City can be collected again.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bottom of the table, including Coffee and Donuts extra ball chance</h3>

<p>If Coffee has not been collected, the right in lane will be lit; rolling through it lights the standup target in the lower left for Coffee. Similarly, if Donuts is not collected, the left in lane will be lit, and rolling through it lights the lower right standup target for Donuts. If Coffee and Donuts are collected within about 30 seconds of each other, the right Truck Stop saucer will be lit for Extra Ball. This feature can only be collected once per ball in play.</p>

<p>Truck Stop has a conventional in/out lane setup. The out lanes are lit alternately for Special after a Jackpot chance begins.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus multiplier is advanced by knocking down all 3 inline drop targets in the center of the table, then hitting the green standup target behind them before the inline drops reset. Completing this sequence increases the bonus multiplier by 1, up to a maximum of 7x. The higher the bonus multiplier is, the shorter the timer lasts before the inline drop targets reset after they have been cleared. Each City letter collected scores 5,000 points in base bonus. The game can keep track of 3 completed grids; this plus a fully complete current grid makes possible a maximum bonus of 7x 400,000 = 2,800,000 points, which is very significant. There is no mid-ball bonus collect. Bonus multipliers are never carried over from ball to ball, but base bonus (City letters) are always built up throughout the whole game.</p>

<h3>Pinball Primer trivia</h3>

<p>The original title for The Pinball Primer was going to be Pinball Rest Stop. The name was changed following concerns that people who typed "Pinball Rest Stop" into a search engine would get results for this game, Truck Stop, rather than the website that became The Pinball Primer. The name "Pinball Primer" was proposed by voidlingBento, a close friend of the author.</p>
