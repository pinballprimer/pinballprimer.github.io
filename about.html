<h1>The Pinball Primer - About and FAQ</h1>

<h2>Who runs this website?</h2>

<p>The Pinball Primer was created and is primarily run by <b>solar_espeon</b> (she/her). Call me espie or Rachel! I don't play in tournaments yet due to my current location and other life stuff, but I plan to; for now I'm just a pinball hobbyist with a deep love of pinball history and rules, including a special interest in the games of the 1970s-90s. I'm the principal author of most of the pages on this website. You can contact me as solar_espeon on Discord or at pinballprimer@gmail.com: I also frequent many pinball streams around Twitch.<br>Other people that have helped compile rules descriptions or tournament settings for tutorials on The Pinball Primer include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Elia "arborelia" Lake - she/her - IFPA #92725 - twitch.tv/arborelia</li>
	<li>GlitchCat7 - he/him - twitch.tv/GlitchCat7</li>
	<li>Kat "FlannelKat" Lake - she/her - IFPA #92727 - twitch.tv/flannelkat</li>
	<li>Lewis "ScoutPilgrim" Bevans - they/them - IFPA #37655</li>
	<li>Lumi Legato - she/they - IFPA #15105</li>
	<li>Noah Crable - he/him - IFPA #36458</li>
	<li>Richie Terry - he/him - IFPA #41582</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Ben Harris (he/him; IFPA #100706; tcpinball.org) helped with some pieces of site design.</p>

<h2>What's the goal of The Pinball Primer?</h2>

<p>The Pinball Primer is designed to be a one-stop shop for anyone looking to learn a pinball table of any era. Whether you're playing casually or in a tournament, and whether you're new to pinball or have years of experience, my vision is for The Pinball Primer to be a place where you can spend 30 seconds to quickly learn the strategy of any table you walk up to, or spend about 5 minutes deeply learning all the rules to truly understand how the game works.</p>

<h2>Why are you doing this? Doesn't [other resource] exist?</h2>

<p>Yes, other resources do exist, but incompleteness in their coverage or quality is precisely why I want to make The Pinball Primer a single, thorough, go-to resource. Inspiration was taken from some of the following places:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://rules.silverballmania.com/home">The Bob Matthews EMcyclopedia.</a> Bob Matthews is one of the longest tenured and most knowledgeable pinball players of all time, with a competition career spanning many decades. He literally wrote the book on strategies for electromechanical tables- that's what is linked here, in wiki form. His "Quickie Version -> Full Detail" page setup directly inspired the layout of my pages. Unfortunately, his wiki doesn't cover any tables released after about 1985, and on many tables, some strategies or scoring features that aren't necessarily competition-viable are omitted.</li>
	<li><a href="https://replayfoundation.org/papa/learning-center/player-guide/rule-sheets/">The PAPA/Replay Foundation rule sheets.</a> The Professional & Amateur Pinball Association hosts rulesheets for dozens and dozens of tables, primarily alphanumeric and 1990s DMD games, written by the best players in the world when those tables were new. This means, though, that many of them are 20-25 years old or older, and may have incomplete or incorrect rules, or outdated strategies. </li>
	<li><a href="https://pintips.net/">Pintips.</a> Pintips is a user submitted forum for super quick notes and how-tos in pinball, but in my experience, the quality is inconsistent at best, as the 1-2 sentence posts can be unclear in what they're referring to or exclude discussion on tables that have multiple ways to play.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Pinball Primer was not created to plagiarize the hard work of any of these people; it is merely intended to compile, refine, and expand upon it to help lower the barrier of entry for anyone who wants to enjoy playing pinball at any level.</p>

<h2>Why do multiple links on the Game List page go to the same guide page?</h2>

<p>Pinball games get re-released for a myriad of reasons, such as having both solid state and electromechanical versions, having versions with different numbers of players, trying to recapitalize on the success of a previously successful layout, or updating a licensed game in time with the release of other related media. If a table was released multiple times under different names with minimal rules changes, they appear under all different names on the game list and are counted separately to help a player that may not know that a game they're looking at has a "sister title", but the different links lead to the same page for efficiency's sake. Such guide pages that detail a table with multiple releases will include notes on the different versions of that game at the top of the page.</p>

<h2>Why don't you have [X] game?</h2>

<p>The answer probably is, it's coming soon! The Pinball Primer is a labor of love and new pages get written when I have time and at a frequency that I know will not burn me out. Games from certain eras or manufacturers may come along slower or less frequently than others, for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Stern Pinball games from 2017 onward, as well as games from newer companies like Spooky Pinball or Barrels of Fun, tend to have very difficult to use virtual recreations (if they have virtual recreations at all), and most of them still receive regular code updates that change the exact feature operation and scoring. It would be too time- and cost-intensive to write guide pages for these games and maintain them at the level of quality I desire from The Pinball Primer. For up-to-date rulesheets of Stern games with full-colour TV screens, check the Stern Insider Connected app or search for discussion about the game on <a href="https://tiltforums.com/">Tilt Forums.</a></li>
	<li>Even though the pinball manufacturer Gottlieb has been out of business for nearly 30 years, the remaining company stakeholders keep a close watch on the distribution of information about Gottlieb games for the purposes of copyright. Specifically, most Gottlieb game manuals and code ROMs are not publicly available for free, making it harder to test and verify the rules of Gottlieb alphanumeric and DMD games compared to other companies. That doesn't mean they're not coming- it's just a slightly bigger time sink that I haven't committed to yet.</li>
	<li><b><i><u>I'm boycotting Jersey Jack Pinball, and you should too.</u></i></b> Their decision to create a Harry Potter pinball (and release it during Pride Month 2025, no less!) helps directly financially support JK Rowling, an exceptionally awful human being who has repeatedly called for the dehumanization and extinction of the LGBTQ+ community, especially trans women. Her name, likeness, or intellectual property should never be anywhere near a community as dedicated and accepting as the pinball scene. Pinball is for everyone! Further, Jersey Jack has chosen to move towards the use of generative AI in their artwork, which is lazy, exceptionally low quality, and seeks only to shred the efforts of hardworking, talented artists and graphic designers for superficial labels of innovation. Do not spend money on any Jersey Jack game, and choose not to play or include them in tournaments, if you are able to do so. The Pinball Primer will never host any rulesheet or tutorial for any game produced by Jersey Jack Pinball in the past, present, or future.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Can I request that a specific table be added?</h2>

<p>Sure! Just don't expect it to be ready immediately. At the end of the day, The Pinball Primer is a hobby, and it takes a fair amount of time to learn a table and then do the write-up on it. Feel free to reach out, though, and we'll do what we can. The Pinball Primer reserves the right to decline any request for a new rulesheet, and requests for tutorials about Jersey Jack Pinball games will be promptly discarded.</p>
