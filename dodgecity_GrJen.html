<h1>Dodge City (Gottlieb, 1965)</h1>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Shoot lit rollunder gates in A-B-C-D-E order. Gates score the value lit in front of the gate on the under-playfield rollover unit. Completing A-B-C-D-E at 1x increases the gate value to 10x; completing A-B-C-D-E at 10x qualifies a 100x mutliplier for one gate shot. Shooting side saucers when lit is also good for reasonable points.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>A-B-C-D-E progression</h3>

<p>The five rollover gates making an arch in the center of the table are labelled A-B-C-D-E. Making a rollunder gate scores the value displayed in front of that gate multiplied by the current multiplier. Side saucers, lit out lanes, and the two center top lanes spin the roto, assigning a new value to each gate. Gates can be worth 2, 3, 4, or 5 points, or a Star can appear; the Star scores only 1 point, but making a gate when it is lit and the Star is showing awards an extra ball. Shooting a lit gate moves the lit letter to the next gate; shooting the E when lit advances the gate score multiplier. Completing A-B-C-D-E turns a 1x multiplier into 10x and moves the lit letter back to A; completing A-B-C-D-E again turns the 10x into 100x; after making one single gate at 100x value, the sequence is reset back to 1x with the A lit. The gate multiplier and currently lit letter gate are preserved from ball to ball, player to player, and game to game.</p>

<h3>Alternating features</h3>

<p>The following playfield features have fluctuating values:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The two upper passive bumpers, which score 1 point or 10 when lit</li>
	<li>The left and right pop bumpers, which score 1 point or 10 when lit</li>
	<li>The saucer value, which rotates between 5, 10, and 15 points</li>
	<li>The saucer lights: lit saucers score 10x value</li>
	<li>The lower passive bumpers, which score 1 point or 10 when lit</li>
	<li>The slingshots, which score 1 point or 10 when lit</li>
	<li>Each pair of out lanes, which score 5 points or 50 + Spin Roto when lit</li>
</ul>
<p>Making a 5-point top lane, 50-point top lane, any rollunder gate, either saucer, or any out lanes alternates whether neither, both or just one feature in each pair listed above is lit, and also rotates the saucer base values between 5, 10, and 15 points.</p>

<p>There are no in lanes; thin rail slingshots allow for two out lanes on each side. There is no end of ball bonus. Maximum 1 extra ball per ball in play. I believe tilt ends game, but only for the player who tilted.</p>
