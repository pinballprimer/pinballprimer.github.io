<h1>Mr. and Mrs. Pac-Man Pinball (Bally, 1982)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Baby Pac-Man (also Bally, 1982), which is a combination video game and pinball table.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>The safe, somewhat boring way to play this game for points is to ignore all of the Pac-Man related maze features and shoot only the left and right saucers, for an increasing value that eventually awards an extra ball and grows to 100,000 points per shot.<br>To play for game progress, clear drop target banks or hit lit standup targets to earn moves in the Pac-Man maze, then shoot either saucer to enter the maze game on the playfield. Use the left flipper to rotate the selected direction, use the right flipper to move; aim to touch every insert on the grid and avoid the red ghost. Lit maze positions award end of ball bonus, and you get 250,000 points per completed grid at the end of the game.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Pac-Man is commonly considered to have one of the hardest skill shots in all of pinball. The skill shot is a precise power plunge that falls into the small lane whose entrance is right at the peak of the upper right u-turn area. Successfully doing so adds 10 moves to the Pac-Man move board and instantly starts the maze mini-game in Pac-Man Aggressive mode, which is explained below. Because of the skill shot's difficulty and the value of the upper drop target's awards, it's recommended to avoid the skill shot entirely and full plunge instead, using the controlled trip to the upper flipper to work on the top drop targets.</p>

<h3>Pac-Man moves and maze</h3>

<p>The rightmost two digits of the numeric display set into the playfield show how many Pac-Man moves you have. You initially start with 0 moves. Ways to earn moves include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Star rollover near upper flipper: 1 move</li>
	<li>Completing the upper drop target bank: 3 moves</li>
	<li>Completing either lower drop target bank: 5 moves</li>
	<li>Hitting a lit standup target after clearing both lower drop target banks: 1 move</li>
	<li>Left in lane and right out lane: 1 move</li>
	<li>Right in lane: 2 moves</li>
	<li>Left out lane: 1 move, or 3 moves if the left out lane gate is lit</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not know if there is a limit to the number of moves that can be stored at once: it is at least 63, and likely 99. When you have 6 moves or more, shoot either saucer to enter the Pac-Man Maze, which is the 5x5 grid of lights on the playfield.</p>

<p>In the maze grid, use the left flipper to rotate which direction Pac-Man is "facing" as indicated by the white arrows above the maze, and use the right flipper to advance Pac-Man one position in the selected direction at the cost of one move. You can wrap around the board from one side to the other. When Pac-Man moves to a space, he lights that space underneath him. Each lit space on the current maze is worth 5,000 points in end of ball bonus. If you complete a maze by lighting all 25 grid locations, a new maze is started immediately (if you still have moves to spare); at the end of the game, you receive 250,000 points for each completed maze alongside the final end of ball bonus. Pac-Man always starts in the center position of the grid; the center position is not lit automatically, though, and you must move Pac-Man back to the center position to earn credit for it. If you take too long to press the right flipper button, Pac-Man may automatically move in the selected direction.</p>

<p>When you enter the maze, one of the corners at random will be lit red. This is Blinky the Ghost, and Pac-Man needs to avoid him. Blinky moves every time Pac-Man moves; starting with the 2nd maze, Blinky can also move on his own if Pac-Man takes too long to move. Blinky cannot enter the center position of the grid. If you are caught by Blinky, you are thrown out of the maze and you lose a life, as indicated by the 5 icons immediately below the maze grid. You can earn 1 extra life by completing both banks of lower drop targets, then hitting all 6 of the standup targets behind them to spell Pac-Man. If you do not have any lives remaining, you cannot re-enter the maze, regardless of how many moves you have stored up. Earning an extra life when you already have the maximum of 5 awards an instant special. If you are thrown out of the maze because you ran out of moves, you do NOT lose a life. If you are thrown out of the maze because Blinky caught you, you do lose a life, but you do not forfeit any moves that were still in your bank.</p>

<p>The maze includes a timer, which is operator-adjusted to be anywhere between 10 and 45 seconds. The timer only runs when you are inside the maze game. If you complete the entire maze before the timer expires, you are awarded an instant special, once per game. It is okay to need multiple trips to the maze to complete it due to running out of moves or being caught by Blinky, and the timer will stop when you are not actively in the maze, but the timer does not reset until a whole new maze begins.</p>

<p>There is an alternate mode for the maze called Pac-Man Aggressive. Aggressive mode can be activated by making the skill shot or by completing the upper drop target bank multiple times (usually 3 or 4 for the first time, then every 2 after that). When the maze is in Aggressive mode, Blinky will run away from Pac-Man instead of chasing him. If Pac-Man collides with Blinky in Aggressive mode, Blinky will be returned to a random corner of the maze, and 50,000 points are scored. Operator settings govern whether Aggressive mode ends after one trip to the maze, after Blinky is eaten once, or at the end of the current ball in play.</p>

<h3>Upper drop targets</h3>

<p>Any completion of the upper drop targets scores 3 moves in the maze. Completing the drop targets when they are unlit will light the yellow arrow. Completing the drop targets when the yellow arrow is lit scores 20,000 points and converts the yellow arrow into a green one. Completing the drop targets when the green arrow is lit scores 30,000 points; if Pac-Man Aggressive is currently qualified, the green arrow stays lit, but if Pac-Man Aggressive is not qualified, the green arrow will be exchanged for a red light. Completing the drop targets when the red light is on scores 50,000 points, qualifies Pac-Man Aggressive, and returns the drop targets to the green arrow level. All drop target lights are reset when the ball drains. An operator setting can mean that the yellow arrow is lit at the start of a ball.</p>

<p>If the left out lane gate is currently closed, completing the top drop targets 2 times opens the gate. The gate redirects a ball from the left out lane back to the left in lane, saving it from the drain. Triggering the left out lane switch while the gate is open scores 3,000 points and 3 maze moves, then closes the gate once the ball is back in the in lane. Once the gate is closed, complete the top drop targets 2 more times to reopen it.</p>

<h3>Saucers</h3>

<p>Any shot to either saucer, whether it is lit to send you to the maze or not, scores and advances the saucer value. When no arrows are lit, the saucer value is 1,000 points; the second saucer scores 10,000 points; every saucer after that on the same ball scores 10,000 points more than the previous one, up to a maximum of 100,000 points. After advancing the value to either 50,000 or 100,000 points (operator adjustable), the next shot to either saucer will also score an extra ball. Maximum 1 extra ball per ball in play.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>The left side of the table bottom is conventional, but the right side has the in and out lanes inverted. The right in lane curves inward and sends the ball over a gap and through a one way gate to the flipper. The lanes closer to the flippers are actually the out lanes and go straight down towards the out hole. Always be on guard whenever the ball heads toward this area at all. A ball going through the in lane can do so slowly, choke up at the mini jump, and fall down anyway, even though it went through the "in" lane. Conversely, a ball going through the inner straight down lane may be able to be nudged back into play off of the corner post that would form the beginning of the jump.<br>Notice as well that the left in/out lane separator is curved at the top, which in practice makes the out lane entrance wider and the in lane entrance narrower.</p>

<h3>End of ball bonus</h3>

<p>Bonus at the end of each ball is equal to 5,000 points for each lit insert on the current maze grid. There is no bonus multiplier or mid-ball bonus collect. Maze progress is always carried from ball to ball. At the end of the game, you also receive a bonus of 250,000 points per completed maze, and 50,000 points per remaining life, so absolutely do not tilt on the final ball of the game.</p>

<p>In competition/novelty play, extra balls score 25,000 points and specials score 50,000 points.</p>
