<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Use the plunge to Select a number with the top rollover button, and ideally open one gate or raise one post via the top lanes. Continue to do this during gameplay by shooting the left orbit, or the upper right Star Gate if it's open, whenever possible. Landing in an out lane or the center saucer spins the backglass wheel; if it lands on a number that's lit because it has been Selected, score 500 points.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Top lanes score 100 points. The five top lanes each light a save feature around the playfield as indicated: from left to right, the lanes will open the top right Star Gate, open the West Gate on the middle left, open the East Gate in the right out lane, raise the Mini Post in the lower left, or raise the Lamp Post between the flippers.</p>

<h3>Selecting and Spinning</h3>

<p>Making the top rollover button, the upper left standup target, the center saucer, or either out lane will Select the current number. The number that will be Selected is indicated by triangular arrow insert on the playfield. 1-point switch hits rotate which number is lit by the triangle arrow. When a number is selected, its round playfield insert and its portion of the backglass wheel light up. Landing in the center saucer or either out lane will spin the backglass wheel. When the wheel stops, 500 points are scored if the arrow is pointing to a lit number, or 50 points if the number is unlit.</p>

<p>Pop bumpers score 1 point, or 10 when lit. Each bumper is lit when one of two numbers is Selected. The top row of bumpers look for 1/2, 3/4, and 5/6; the bottom row of bumpers looks for 7/8 and 9/10.</p>

<p>The left orbit always scores 300 points. If the triangle arrow is pointing at #10, the left orbit is lit for extra ball. Maximum one extra ball per ball in play.</p>

<p>Lit numbers are removed at the end of the ball.</p>

<h3>Gates and posts galore</h3>

<p>The upper right Star Gate is only lit by the leftmost top lane. Making the gate when lit scores 300 points and puts the ball in the shooter lane for a replunge.
<br>The West Gate is in the middle-leftnear the upper entrance to the left out lane. It is only opened by the second top lane from left. When open, the gate scores 300 points and redirects the ball to the left flipper and away from the out lane.
<br>The East Gate is in the right out lane. Using the gate puts the ball back in the shooter lane for a replunge. The gate is located below the right out lane switch, so using this gate does allow you to Select & Spin and still keep the ball.
<br>Once open, gates stay open for the rest of the ball and do not close when used.</p>

<p>The lamp post is raised by the rightmost top lane or the upper of the two yellow standup targets. When raised, this post completely blocks off the center drain as a reward.
<br>The mini post is raised by the second top lane from right or the lower of the two right yellow standup targets. When the mini post is raised, the lower entrance to the left out lane is partially, but not completely, blocked. Use nudging to ensure the ball hits this post and avoids the left out lane when possible.
<br>Both posts are lowered by the Down Post rollover button in the center of the table, or when the ball drains.</p>

<h3>Differences seen in Roto, the add-a-ball version</h3>

<p>All top lanes Select the current number. The top rollover button changes the selected number.</p>
<p>Spinning the backglass wheel and landing on a lit number scores an extra ball instead of 500 points. Extra balls are played as an extended play feature, with the ball being launched into play upwards between the flippers from the out hole.</p>
<p>There is no Star Gate, East Gate, or Lamp Post. Instead of the East Gate, a second small post partially blocks the right out lane called the Tiny Post, and it is functionally identical to the Mini Post. In place of the Star Gate is a third right yellow standup target. On Roto, the three targets award (from top to bottom) Up Tiny Post, Opens Gate, and Up Mini Post. The center playfield rollover button still lowers both posts. The West Gate, now referred to simply as "Gate", still scores 300 points when open.</p>
