<h1>Pinball Magic (Capcom, 1995)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Theatre of Magic (Bally Williams, 1995) or Magic (Stern Electronics, 1979).</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>For quick points, shoot the flashing shots to earn Tricks, worth a minimum of 10,000,000 points each. For high scores, play 3-ball multiball: complete the Magic drop targets or the 3-bank of standup targets to light locks at the left ramp. Be sure to lock 2 balls at the left ramp before shooting the scoop in the lower right so that you start Magic Mayhem 3-ball multiball instead of Mini Mayhem 2-ball. During Magic Mayhem, the left ramp scores jackpot; the right orbit lights jackpot, or adds 10,000,000 to the jackpot for the rest of the game if the jackpot itself was already lit.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>There are two flavors of skill shot: a full plunge, which does a loop-de-loop above the magic hat and rolls up and around the center loop, or a short plunge, which falls off the loop-de-loop into the magic hat itself. On odd-numbered balls, the skill shot is the magic hat short plunge, which scores 5,000,000 points. On even-numbered balls, the skill shot is the full plunge to the center loop, which starts Super Spinner where the spinner scores 100,000 points per spin for about 30 seconds.</p>

<p>If the center loop or magic hat are lit for other features, they can be awarded off the plunge. The first trick of the game, Nostradamus 1, awards 10,000,000 points for making the center loop, which immediately overshadows the 5,000,000 you would get from the magic hat skill shot. If one or more balls have been locked, a short plunge into the magic hat will immediately start Mini or Magic Mayhem, depending on whether 1 or 2 balls were locked first. Following a lock, in fact, the game tells you that the skill shot <i>is</i> starting multiball from the magic hat. This is not advised unless 2 balls have been locked, and the magic hat starts the full Magic Mayhem.</p>

<h3>Game progression: Magic Tricks</h3>

<p>The basic game progression consists of Magic Tricks: 21 of them, in three groups of 7, each consisting of a handful of shots to one of the various features in the game. Tricks are always played in the same order. Level 1 tricks score 10,000,000 points each; level 2 tricks score 20,000,000 each; level 3 tricks score 30,000,000 each.</p>

<p><i>Level 1</i></p>
<ol>
	<li><u>Nostradamus- Bend the Spoon.</u> Shoot the center loop. This trick can easily be earned from the first skill shot of the game.</li>
	<li><u>Shaman- Swallow the Sword.</u> Shoot the captive ball.</li>
	<li><u>Hansen- Float the Ball.</u> Shoot the Stage ramp, between the center loop and the Magic drop targets.</li>
	<li><u>Mystique- Trunk Escape.</u> Shoot the left ramp.</li>
	<li><u>Kenzo- Linking Rings.</u> Shoot the center loop twice. If your Level 1 Mystique shot also locked a ball for multiball, you can easily get one of the two shots for Level 1 Kenzo off the ensuing plunge.</li>
	<li><u>Jadugar- Magic Carpet Ride.</u> Shoot the left ramp again.</li>
	<li><u>Matra Magna- Silence the Critics.</u> Shoot the left ramp yet again. The ball will be diverted so that it "rides" the magic wand down the playfield with the aid of a magnet. Use the right flipper to detach the ball from the magnet early. The goal is to have the ball land in one of the two holes indicated by red lights behind/above the Magic drop targets. This is arguably the hardest and most inconsistent trick in the game, as the timing for getting the ball to drop off the wand can vary wildly from game to game, and if the ball is wobbling from side to side as it comes down the wand, it can be very difficult to get the ball to stick into a hole. It may take several shots to the left ramp and several attempts to make this shot. If it's not something you can get used to, you may need to abandon the trick progression and revert to a multiball strategy.</li>
</ol>

<p><i>Level 2</i></p>
<ol>
	<li><u>Nostradamus- Morph Chamber.</u> Hit any of the three standup targets on the left side of the game.</li>
	<li><u>Shaman- Vanishing Act.</u> Shoot the lower right scoop, either via a direct flipper shot or a Magic Hat skill shot. Remember that this will also start multiball if one or more balls have been locked.</li>
	<li><u>Hansen- Sword Trick.</u> Shoot the captive ball.</li>
	<li><u>Mystique- Nothing Up My Sleeve.</u> Shoot the right orbit.</li>
	<li><u>Kenzo- Vanishing Elephant.</u> Shoot the lower right scoop again.</li>
	<li><u>Jadugar- Make Three Wishes.</u> Shoot the Genie Bottle scoop in the lower left. Despite the trick's name, you only need to make this shot once.</li>
	<li><u>Matra Magna- Triple Power Play.</u> Shoot the left ramp 3 times to lock 3 balls. Progress on Triple Power Play cannot be made unless there is only one ball in play. These left ramp locks do not require completing the Magic drop targets to light the locks first; you're effectively getting a 3-ball Magic Mayhem multiball for free.</li>
</ol>

<p><i>Level 3</i></p>
<ol>
	<li><u>Nostradamus- Vanish the World.</u> Shoot the magic hat.</li>
	<li><u>Shaman- Spell the Secret Word.</u> The secret word is Magic- complete the Magic drop targets.</li>
	<li><u>Hansen- Locked Ball Trick.</u> Shoot the left ramp.</li>
	<li><u>Mystique- Levitate the Ball.</u> Shoot the Stage center ramp.</li>
	<li><u>Kenzo- Magic 8.</u> Complete both the Magic drop target 5-bank and the 3 Morph standup targets on the left.</li>
	<li><u>Jadugar- Presto-Chango.</u> Hit the colour ball lower right standup target 6 times to collect the 6 different colours.</li>
	<li><u>Matra Magna- Defeat the Power.</u> This is the game's wizard mode. Hit 100 switches anywhere in the game. The most efficient way to do so is to shoot the center loop to get the spinner moving. The game doesn't show you your score throughout this, but I expect that each switch scores about 1,000,000 points. If you do hit 100 switches, you score 500,000,000 points and the entire trick sequence resets. Like any other trick, and unlike most wizard modes in pinball, Defeat the Power continues across balls in play if you drain in the meantime, and it is always a single-ball mode.</li>
</ol>

<p>After clearing Defeat the Power, the entire Trick sequence resets. On the second lap, you'll start again at level 1, but completing the level 1 tricks for the second time will score 40,000,000 points each. I am not sure how high the per-trick value can go if the entire progression is completed multiple times.</p>

<h3>Locks and multiball</h3>

<p>Completing the Magic drop targets in the center of the table lights one lock at the left ramp. (One lock is lit for free at the start of the game.) Shooting the left ramp with lock lit causes the magic wand magnet system to drop the ball in the trunk on the right. Lock status is indicated by the sign above the left ramp; solidly lit green lights represent locked balls, and flashing green lights represent available locks. After at least one lock has been made, multiball is available with the next shot to the lower right scoop or magic hat skill shot.</p>

<p>If the lower right scoop is shot with 1 ball locked, Mini Mayhem multiball begins with 2 balls in play. If 2 balls were locked first, shooting the right scoop starts Magic Mayhem multiball with 3 balls. Rules between Mini Mayhem and Magic Mayhem are similar: shoot the left ramp to score and unlight the jackpot, and shoot the right orbit to relight the jackpot. In Mini Mayhem, the jackpot is always worth 20,000,000 points, and cannot be raised. In Magic Mayhem, the jackpot is worth 20,000,000 points at the start of the game, but shooting the right orbit again when jackpot is already lit increases the jackpot by 10,000,000 points. The jackpot is never reset once it is raised; it holds its value after being collected, <i>and in all future Magic Mayhem multiballs.</i> There is no meaningful limit to the value of the Magic Mayhem jackpot- with the glass off, I have confirmed that the jackpot can exceeded 1,000,000,000 points- but a more attainable and effective jackpot value would be more like 50 or 70 million. No matter what the Magic Mayhem jackpot is raised to, the Mini Mayhem jackpot will always be 20,000,000 points. Magic Mayhem does not get downgraded to Mini Mayhem when the multiball drains from 3 balls to 2; as long as multiball began with 3 balls, you can continue to use the Magic Mayhem rules for as long as there are 2 or more balls in play.</p>

<p>There is no ball save or multiball restart at the beginning of either type of multiball. If you can intentionally do so, try to leave just one target in the Magic drop bank or Morph standup bank remaining when multiball ends so that it takes as few shots and targets to relight locks and get back to multiball.</p>

<h3>Box Office and the Stage</h3>

<p>Shoot the Stage center ramp to score the Stage value times the lit multiplier. The Stage value itself is equal to 1,000,000 points plus an additional 2,000 for each pop bumper hit over the course of the game so far. Subsequent shots to the Stage ramp score 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x, and 10x the Stage value, before returning back to 1x. After the Stage ramp is made, the ball is dropped into the pop bumper area, which is usually able to contribute about 20,000 points' worth of bumpers to its value.</p>

<h3>Captive ball awards</h3>

<p>The captive ball awards reset at the start of each ball, and there are 5 in total.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Super Loops: causes one of the two in lanes to be lit for Light Loop. The lit in lane alternates with each slingshot hit. Lit loops score 500,000 points, and if you repeatedly combo a loop each successive shot is worth 500,000 more than the last.</li>
	<li>Super Spinner: for about 30 seconds, the spinner in the center loop scores 100,000 points per spin (usually it scores only 5,000 per spin).</li>
	<li>Lite Showtime: the center Stage ramp is lit for Amateur Hour, a 30-second frenzy mode. During Amateur Hour, all switches in the game score 250,000 points. If you hit 40 switches within the 30 seconds, you receive an additional award of 20,000,000 points. The best way to rack up switch hits is via the spinner.</li>
	<li>Advance Trick: the current Magic Trick is completed for you. This cannot be used on Matra Magna's tricks (Silence the Critics, Triple Power Play, or Defeat the Power). Since this requires 4 captive ball shots, it's usually not worth going out of your way for, though it can be helpful for some of the more annoying Level 3 tricks like Kenzo's Magic 8 or Jadugar's Presto-Chango.</li>
	<li>Lite Extra Ball: this award makes an extra ball available at the green post target in the lower left near the Genie Bottle scoop.</li>
</ol>
<p>The captive ball award sequence resets when extra ball is lit, or if more than 10 seconds pass after redeeming Advance Trick without hitting the captive ball again, or at the end of each ball in play.</p>

<h3>Genie Bottle</h3>

<p>Shooting the lower left scoop directly starts the Genie Bottle mystery round. I don't have a clue how this works. You're offered two doors; when you pick one, sometimes nothing happens, sometimes you get an award, and sometimes you're taken to another decision. I've never seen the award from this be anything other than miscellaneous points (less than 5,000,000) or light a lock for multiball. Not worth paying much attention to.</p>

<h3>Magic and Morph targets</h3>

<p>In addition to lighting a lock at the left ramp when either bank is completed, knocking down all of the Magic drop targets will increase the bonus multiplier toward its maximum of 9x, and lighting all three Morph targets will relight the kickback in the left out lane if it has already been used. The left flipper rotates which targets in the Morph bank are lit to make it easier to light all of them.</p>

<h3>Colour ball target</h3>

<p>The lower right standup target has a crystal ball on top of it. Hit it once to start it rotating between white, red, orange, yellow, green, and blue; these colours each correspond to one of the 6 magicians whose tricks you complete throughout the game. The dot display will tell you which colour corresponds to the magician whose trick is currently in progress; hit the lower right standup target again when the correct colour is lit to score 1,000,000 points.

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Pinball Magic has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes are lit alternately based on slingshot hits for Lite Loop, which increases the value of the center loop (right in lane) or right orbit (left in lane). The right out lane is lit for Jinx, a big-score award usually worth a couple million points. The left out lane has an automatic kickback called Miraculous Save that is on at the start of each ball, turns off when used, and is relit by completing the Morph standup targets on the left.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is calculated as a count of switch hits throughout the game plus 1,000,000 points per completed trick, all multiplied by the bonus multiplier. At the end of a long ball or game, bonus can be guaranteed to be at least 10,000,000 points times a multiplier of up to 9...don't ignore this, and don't tilt at the end of a good ball or good game. Bonus multiplier is advanced with each completion of the Magic drop targets and can never be carried over. There is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>There are no playfield specials. Replay scores and extra balls can be set to score points for competition/novelty play; I have not been able to confirm the exact award, but would expect something like 25,000,000 or 50,000,000.</p>

<p>"Reappearing ball" ball save can last 0-15 seconds. Default is 7.</p>

<p>The lock, captive ball, and kickback relight features all have their own difficulty settings. I have not investigated what is different on each setting.</p>
